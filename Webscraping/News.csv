"12 December, 2023 ",First-time MLA and four-time state General Secretary Bhajan Lal Sharma: BJP signals organisational importance in choosing new CM for Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-rajasthan-general-secretary-bhajan-lal-sharma-cm/,"He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the CM-designate of Rajasthan. Further, his appointment is seen as a major deviation from the general political trend. Usually, seniority and political growth had been adjudged by the number of times a leader has been elected to the state assembly or Lok Sabha. 56-year-old Bhajan Lal Sharma is a first-time MLA. He completed his MA (politics) from Rajasthan University, Jaipur, in 1993.He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The BJP had fielded him after denying a ticket to the sitting MLA Ashok Lahoti. However, Sharma, a resident of Bharatpur, is said to have a strong hold on organisational politics. Before plunging into electoral politics, he had been working in the organisation for a long time. Bhajan Lal Sharma has been playing an important part in BJP’s organisational structure in Rajasthan. He has served as the state general secretary for the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. Previously, he had been associated with RSS and ABVP. For this reason, he is considered close to the party’s ideological mentor RSS, and party chief JP Nadda.The three major announcements on three consecutive days have signalled that the organisational importance played a major role in these major selections. A key similarity in these decisions has been the history of these leaders in serving various organisational roles and strengthening the party’s cadre in these states. Apart from Sharma, Dr. Mohan Yadav, the new CM-designate of Madhya Pradesh had held several organisational posts in BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. Yadav, who started student politics at Madhav Science College, and held many positions in the party. In 1982, he was the co-secretary of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union and in 1984, he was the President of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union.Mohan Yadav assumed the responsibility of Municipal Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Ujjain) in the year 1984 and Department Head in 1986. In the year 1988, Yadav was the state co-secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Madhya Pradesh) and a member of the national executive. He was the State Minister of the State Unit of the Council in 1989-90 and the National Minister of the Council in the year 1991-92. In 1993-95, he served as the functionary (Sangh Karyavah) of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Ujjain Nagar. Additionally, his appointment was also seen as a major signal of political empowerment for the Yadav community, a dominant political force in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, have lacked proper proportional representation owing to the family-oriented politics of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Similarly, Vishnu Deo Sai, the next CM-designate of Chhattisgarh held the top organisational post in BJP’s Chhattisgarh unit. He served as Chhattisgarh BJP President from 2006 to 2013. His appointment also signalled a strong empowerment for the tribal community which was earlier witnessed when BJP-led NDA picked Droupadi Murmu for the Presidential post.   With all these new appointments, BJP signals that its motto ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (inclusivity) will be counter to the opposition’s push for caste census and proportional representation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Center redefines terrorism in new criminal code, includes actions that threaten India’s economic security: Report ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/center-redefines-terrorism-includes-actions-threatens-india-economic-security/,"The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionaryOn 12th December (Tuesday), the Union government revamped the legal definition of “a terrorist act”. Any action threatening India’s economic security will be treated as a ‘terrorist act’ under the new criminal code. The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionary, as reported by NDTV.#NewCriminalCode pic.twitter.com/g30k36MjeIAccording to Section 113 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, those who threaten, or are likely to threaten, the country by causing “damage to the monetary stability of India, by way of production or smuggling or circulation of counterfeit Indian paper currency…” commit a terrorist act.Notably, on 11th December, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had notified Lok Sabha that the three criminal law bills would be withdrawn. He added that the bills would be replaced with three new bills to incorporate the recommendations proposed by a parliamentary committee. Pertinent to note that the revised versions of all three were tabled in the Lok Sabha this evening (12th December).A Statement from the office of the Home Minister had said, “The bill (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, and Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita) was referred to Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs on August 18 for consideration. The Committee held several rounds of discussion with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, domain experts, and various stakeholders and submitted its reports along with recommendations on November 10.”Apart from revamping the definition of terrorist act, the government has added two new sections to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It is one of three bills that is now slated to replace current criminal laws, including the Code of Criminal Procedure. As per media reports, the first addition is the inclusion of Section 86. This newly added section includes harming a woman’s mental health in its definition of “cruelty”. Section 85 provided a three-year jail term for a husband, or members of his family, found guilty of subjecting his wife to cruel treatment in the previous version of the bill. However, the previous version didn’t define “cruel treatment” which has now been included, and the definition, significantly, extends to harming the woman’s mental health as well as her physical well-being. The second section prescribes a two-year imprisonment for disclosing the identity of a sexual assault victim from court proceedings without their consent.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",K Annamalai slams temple management and HR&CE over attack on Sabarimala devotees at Tamil Nadu’s Srirangam temple,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/k-annamalai-slams-temple-management-and-hrce-over-attack-on-sabarimala-devotees-at-srirangam-temple/,"Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.On 12th December (Tuesday), temple management staff and police allegedly manhandled and assaulted devotees in the Trichy Srirangam Temple premises, in Tamil Nadu. The injured Ayyappa devotees have been admitted to Srirangam Government Hospital for treatment. Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.Several devotees, including Andhra Ayyappa Bakhtar Chenna Rao, were assaulted. Following this, Ayyappa devotees filed a police complaint against three temporary employees Selvam, Vignesh, and Bharat who are accused of assaulting the devotees as well as against the temple administration. As per reports, it is alleged that the police deployed in the temple premises, instead of supporting the assaulted Ayyappa devotees, supported the accused temple staff. They reportedly pushed the injured devotees out of the temple and tried to cover up the attack. Subsequently, more than a hundred Ayyappa devotees protested at places like Karthikai Gopuram and Flagpole against the assault on devotees and mismanagement. However, the police reportedly stopped Ayyappa devotees who were protesting. A video footage of the incident is going viral on social media which has created a stir among the devotees. Sharing the video of an injured Ayyappa devotee, BJP state president K Annamalai condemned the incident. He also launched a scathing attack on temple management authorities including Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR & CE). Annamalai asserted that a government that doesn’t believe in Hindu dharma has no business to oversee or control the management of Hindu temples. Taking to X, he wrote, “A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples. The Iyyappa devotees who have had 42 days of Vrath, with all devotion, wanted to pray to Ranganatha Swamy after their return from Sabarimala. The Iyyappa devotees questioned the long wait in the queue and special treatment to a select few who were assaulted near the sanctum sanctorum & which resulted in bloodshed inside the Temple premises.”  A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples.

Tamil Nadu BJP’s Trichy district unit will today hold a protest outside the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy Temple against the TN HR&CE department, demanding the strictest action against those spoiling the sanctity of the Temple.” Meanwhile, Ayyappa devotees and opposition parties have been accusing the state governments of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. Apart from Tamil Nadu, in Kerala, the opposition leaders have alleged that the Kerala Police have been diverted to ensure the statewide trip of CM Pinnrayi Vijayan rather than providing adequate police security for management and crowd control at Sabarimala pilgrimage. The devotees have been waiting for more than 20 hours in long queues. Several videos are doing rounds on the internet in which devotees have highlighted mismanagement for this year’s Sabarimala pilgrimage. In many cases, the police and temple management authorities have manhandled devotees for highlighting these issues. Reportedly, the devotees are facing an acute shortage of basic amenities like clean water and food, and one 11-year-old girl child died.  Fate of Ayyappa Devotees in Kerala !!!As u all know sabarimala pilgrimage is a significant annual Hindu pilgrimage in Kerala attracting millions of devotees.

The Vijayan government is now showing its anger towards the believers for their combined efforts to ensure all the religious protocols in place in Sabarimala are intact, which they got from the court.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"5 December, 2023 ","BJP increases vote share in Telangana but fails to win even as anger brewed against KCR: How it got the chemistry wrong, not mathematics",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-increase-voteshare-telangana-fails-win-anger-kcr-result-analysis/,"The anger against KCR was real. So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023.At one of the pre-2019 meetings in Hyderabad, a BJP karyakarta stood up and asked the leader presiding that meeting – All these years, we have been dancing in front of the party office to celebrate victories in other states. When will we dance at our office to celebrate our victories in our state? The hall reverberated with claps, specifically at the tone and manner in which the question was posed – a tone steeped in anguish yet passionate to put everything at stake so that he could dance for the said reason. For many decades leading up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, this dance eluded the karyakarta. Hence the anguish. They saw real hope post-2014. Hence the excitement. The passion was always there. It was the direction that they were looking for. And the karyakartas got their first opportunity to dance when the BJP won an unprecedented 4 Lok Sabha seats for the first time in Telangana. The first step towards the ultimate dream of capturing power in Telangana was made. Bandi Sanjay Kumar was made President of the party. The second step was made. The party won the all-important Dubbaka bye-poll. Third step. The party stormed the GHMC polls in an unprecedented manner. Fourth step. The party President started his padayatra, right from Owaisi’s bastion. He stood right before Charminar and made thousands of karyakartas chant Bharat Mata ki Jai, Vande Mataram and Jai Shree Ram – something people thought was never possible. Yeah yeah – he got “communal” and all that. But you need to know about Owaisi’s bastion to understand the monumental scale of what the karyakarta felt when Bandi Sanjay did what he did, on the day he started his padayatra. Fifth step. A big leap.  KCR fired one of his best lieutenants – Eatata Rajendar. The BJP convinced him to join them. He did and won the all-important Huzurabad bye-election. The stride of the steps was just increasing. The BJP held its national executive in Hyderabad and then held a massive public meeting – the crowd was so huge that the Prime Minister was pleasantly surprised and patted Bandi Sanjay on his back for it. Small gesture, but gave much-needed fuel to continue the pace of the steps being taken for the ultimate goal – power in Telangana in 2023. A Congress MLA resigned and joined the BJP, thus prompting a bye-election. Rahul Gandhi’s famed BJ Yatra was passing through the state when this bye-election was happening. KCR sent 80 of its MLAs to this one constituency to defeat the BJP. Against such strong odds, the BJP still put up a great fight despite losing this seat. A setback but definitely not the end of the road. Mysteriously, very mysteriously, this setback became the end of the road for the BJP’s rise in the state!The karyakarta was flabbergasted when Bandi Sanjay’s term was not extended after his 3-year term ended in March 2023. Yes, missteps were made. The mighty BJP could have easily groomed Bandi Sanjay better when certain issues were being brought to the fore. It is still an abiding mystery why the central unit of the party could not find the right resources to groom a fledgling state unit. It’s not as if this is something new for a party like the BJP. They have tremendous experience and accessibility to resources to handle situations like this. The backlash from the karyakarta at removing Bandi Sanjay from the position wasn’t anticipated by the central unit. I find it very hard to believe though – for a party like the BJP that thrives on feedback, it is tough to believe that they didn’t anticipate this. For a party like the BJP that did what they did in MP and Chhattisgarh, it is indeed a mystery as to why they gave up on Telangana. Yes, we can list out all the missteps the party took in the run-up to the 2023 elections. We can talk about the mathematics of the election. In fact, I started this article to explain the mathematics behind BJP’s loss. Using the below graphic, I wanted to explain how the party that took GHMC by storm in 2020 has failed woefully in 2023 in the exact same area. I wanted to refer to the increase in overall vote percentage for the party; the victory in the northern areas of Telangana etc. And then I read this beautiful post written by a Twitter handle – Gems of KCR. This is when it dawned upon me that the BJP lost this election because it faltered on chemistry, not on the mathematics of the election. Who is the person behind GemsOfKCR?I'm a common man, hailing from a humble family background from rural Telangana, fought for my village's issues. In 2016 questioned BRS MLA in public and asked him to solve my village problem. He has promised to solve but he didn't.Instead of…The anger against KCR was real (we explained in multiple articles here on OpIndia why people are angry). So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023. This election is BJP’s loss more than the Congress’s victory (not to take away credit, but Congress’s rise only coincided with BJP’s downfall). The karyakarta who wanted to dance the ultimate step in 2023 will now have to wait till for 2028 for the next chance. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India’s defeat. Utterly disgraceful behaviour.”Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan. Just yesterday, they were celebrating India's defeat. Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"18 November, 2023 ",Madhya Pradesh: Political fight between two groups in Jabalpur portrayed online as an attack on Sikhs,https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/madhya-pradesh-jabalpur-sikh-man-beaten-poltiical-fight-given-communal-angle-fact-check/,"The scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during the Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. On Friday (17th November), a video of a confrontation between two groups was falsely presented as a hate crime against the Sikh community by a Hindu mob.The incident reportedly took place in Jabalpur city of Madhya Pradesh. A Sikh man in a scooter was assaulted by a group of men, the video of which went viral on social media.Prominent fake news peddlers attempted to give a communal spin to the incident. “Sikh was attacked by a Hindu mob…Nobody is safe under BJP ruled government unless he is a BJP supporter,” claimed Islamist X handle ‘RheA’.Another Islamist claimed, “First Muslim, then Dalit and now Sikh.”“Madhya Pradesh – Sikh attacked by Hindu mob in Jabalpur. While raising religious slogans, people badly beat up a person from the Sikh community,” tweeted one ‘mdirfan997’.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) also amplified the incident and asked the Madhya Pradesh Police to take action.SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami has taken notice of a viral video from Jabalpur, in which, a Sikh is seen being assaulted by some men. He said that such an incident of assault with insult to Sikh turban and Kes (unshorn hair) is highly unfortunate and strongly condemnable.… https://t.co/HAVPR9P1D5Contrary to claims on social media, the scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. There was no ‘communal angle’ in the incident.Secretary of the Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA), Tejinder Singh Renu, informed, “A video circulated widely on social media (screenshots shared) is from Jabalpur; but it has nothing to do with #Hindu #Sikh enmity.”“Yesterday there were elections in Madhya Pradesh and this incident happened in the Madan Mahal area. The Sikh man being thrashed is a political leader of the area and the men beating him mercilessly are from another political party,” he added.A video circulated widely on social media (screenshots shared) is from Jabalpur; but it has nothing to do with #Hindu #Sikh enmity.Yesterday there were elections in Madhya Pradesh and this incident happened in the Madan Mahal area.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Washington Post and its hit job on ‘Disinfo Lab’: Exposing the nefarious campaign to discredit Indian OSINT handle before 2024 Lok Sabha election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/,"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, The Washington Post has launched a campaign of sorts to de-legitimise those exposing anti-India narratives and promote individuals disseminating propaganda against India.On Sunday (10th December), the leftist media outlet carried out a hit job on the Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’ To this effect, it published an article titled ‘Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.’The development comes two days after American political commentator Jack Posobiec revealed how The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Priyanshu Verma had been soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab.’‘Disinfo Lab’ is the same OSINT handle, which earlier exposed how the US State Department was relying on misleading data (sourced from Christian evangelist groups and radical Islamist outfits) to allege a decline in India’s religious freedom.It was thus obvious that US-based leftist media outlets such as The Washington Post would make attempts to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’ sooner or later. Based on ‘sources’, Pranshu Verma and his two other colleagues claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Intelligence Officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.The trio at The Washington Post alleged that the objective of ‘Disinfo Lab’ is to ‘research and discredit foreign critics of the Modi government’, ‘combine fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims’, ‘intimidate individuals overseas’ and ‘run covert influence operation.’However, a cursory look at the website of the OSINT handle reveals that it is focused on uncovering disinformation campaigns, aimed at tarnishing the image of India on a global scale. Nevertheless, this did not stop The Washington Post from making sweeping claims about it. “The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” it brazened out.The leftist media outlet roped in several ‘experts’ to suggest that the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi is using an OSINT handle with 45.6K followers to undermine political rivals and create a global narrative.One such expert was an ‘academic’ named Joyjeet Pal. He claimed, “The Indian right wing is a new player that has arrived on the world stage and wants to shape global discussion…So far, much of it is done in the same way it’s done within India — through crude, blunt force. But it’s getting smarter.” The Washinton Post introduced Pal as a University of Michigan Professor ‘who studies disinformation in India.’ Interestingly, he is the same ‘expert’ whose obscure research was used by Indian leftist propaganda outlet The Wire to discredit calls for investigating the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Claim: Raksha Mantri @rajnathsingh admitted on @CNNnews18 that Chinese soldiers crossed Indian side of LACFact: The Minister was referring to differing perceptions of LAC & presence of Chinese troops It is being misinterpreted as if Chinese troops entered Indian side of LAC pic.twitter.com/Xews6Ba1bqAnother controversial expert cited by The Washington Post in its report was ‘journalist’ Ajai Shukla. He claimed, “(The defence establishment) exists to serve national and strategic interests, not political interests. But the BJP under Modi has seen critics as anti-Indian, the enemies of India itself.”Shukla has a history of peddling fake news (here and here) in the context of the India-China border dispute. He had also disseminated conspiracy theories post the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and was dubbed sexist by a prominent Italian journalist. Despite such dwindling credibility, The Washington Post roped him as an expert for its propaganda-laden piece on ‘Disinfo Lab.’India has been under tremendous pressure to choose sides, following the Russia-Ukraine war. The US state apparatus and the media on several occasions had even threatened India with sanctions for purchasing oil from Russia, only to receive befitting replies from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Nevertheless, The Washington Post saw it as an opportunity to attack India’s neutral position in the ongoing crisis. “Coordinated social media accounts have been found to play a role, for instance, in spreading identical posts in support of Russia, an important supplier of weapons and energy to India…” it furthered the US State narrative.The leftist news outlet targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.Throughout its article, The Washington Post desperately tried to whitewash both anti-Hindu and anti-India activists and paint them as ‘victims’ of the social media exposé by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ One such activist mentioned by the leftist media outlet happens to be Pieter Friedrich, who has ties to Khalistani terrorist Bhajan Bhinder.“The organization released a dossier nearly 100 pages long alleging that Pieter Friedrich, a California-based activist and journalist who has written magazine articles and given public speeches critical of the BJP and affiliated Hindu-nationalist groups, had ties to the Sikh separatist movement and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. The Disinfo Lab burrowed into California state records to uncover Friedrich’s employment history, published his parents’ names and plotted detailed graphs about his social media activity,” it claimed.1) The days of people like Friedrich making threats against non-white people,especially because of the color of their skin, their religious affiliation, or their country of origin must remain behind us.In 2021, OpIndia reported how Pieter Friedrich evolved from a Christian zealot and a Gandhi basher to a ‘critic of Hindu fascism’ and a Khalistani asset. In June last year, he was slammed for allegedly giving death threats to a Hindu US Representative from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi.The Washington Post lamented that ‘Disinfo Lab’, which posted a plethora of evidence tying ‘activist’ Sunita Vishwanath to far-left billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), was used against Congress scion Rahul Gandhi.“The Disinfo Lab dug into her past and reported that a nonprofit she launched to help female Afghan refugees had received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Two months later, after Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting in Washington with Viswanath as part of a U.S. tour, Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted a photo of the meeting and shared a flowchart stamped with the Disinfo Lab logo illustrating Viswanath’s connections to Soros,” wrote the leftist media outlet.Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by OSF. She is also the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr)’ and has tried to create hysteria and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We are especially appalled by the most recent nightmare of the Kashmiri people, and the situation of 1.9 million people in India who are rendered stateless due to the imposition of the travesty called the National Register of Citizens”, Vishwanath said in 2019. In September 2021, she also participated in the Hinduphobic conference ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva.’ The Washington Post also roped in the policy director of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr), Ria Chakraborty, to make a case for an organisation named ‘Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC).’➡️IAMC's terror angleIAMC has close ties with terror organizations like SIMI, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami.Infact, Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of SIMI, was once hosted as a guest at IAMC.Research credit – @DisinfoLab pic.twitter.com/iufbOJy9gsAccording to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Indian Americal Muslim Council has links [pdf] with the banned Islamic terror outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).Besides, the Indian American Muslim Council has ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) through its founder Shaik Ubaid. The IAMC is a Jamat-e-Islami-backed lobbyist organisation claiming to be a rights advocacy group.It had been caught spreading fake news to further the Islamist cause in India. It had also been slapped with the UAPA in 2021.The Washington Post also made references to anti-Brahmin activist Thenmozhi Soundarajan and her organisation ‘Equality Labs’. Soundarajan had shot to fame in 2018 after the then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clicked pictures with a poster, designed by her, carrying the tagline ‘Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy.’In April 2022, tech giant Google cancelled a talk by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, owing to the fear that it might create ‘division and rancour’ in the workplace. Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry had said, “We also made the decision to not move forward with the proposed talk which — rather than bringing our community together and raising awareness — was creating division and rancour.”In November last year, she went on an unhinged tirade against Yoga. During the one-and-a-half-hour-long podcast, Soundararajan cast aspersions on the history of the ancient Indian Hindu practice and claimed that it was used by Brahmins to oppress the Dalit community. She also insinuated that Yoga had an in-built system of hierarchy, which supposedly made it vulnerable to abuse.What does it mean to address the structural violence at the heart of yoga?

Check it on the latest #conspirituality pod https://t.co/7OadWRA1EP pic.twitter.com/gWgEWCwIv7The Washington Post also attempted to whitewash far-left billionaire George Soros and his nefarious anti-India agenda.The leftist media outlet wrote, “In February, Soros, a frequent critic of Modi, warned in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that the Indian leader was undemocratic and would lose his “stranglehold” over the Indian government. A day later, the Disinfo Lab posted a lengthy tweet thread alleging that Soros had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and manipulated “fake” U.S.-based advocacy groups to smear India. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundations called the Disinfo Lab’s claims “entirely baseless” and said they were part of a “campaign by this site and others in India against advocates of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law in the service of the political aims of the BJP and its allies.”“India has been fighting a ‘perception war’ on all fronts since the start of 2023. On February 16 this year, George Soros exploited the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and launched a scathing attack on the Indian government.He claimed, “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined…Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”Soros accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he added.The Hungarian-American billionaire also said that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time.The Hungarian-American billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including Freedom House and  V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute to tarnish the image of India at a global level.In January 2020, the American billionaire committed $1 billion to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation.Throughout the article, The Washington Post resorted to insinuations, and source-based allegations to discredit ‘Disinfo Lab.’ However, it failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of the Indian OSINT handle.The leftist news outlet had not refuted the assertion by ‘Disinfo lab’ that its exposé had led to the shutting down of several sources of fake data. “In its response to The Post, the Disinfo Lab pointed to its record of forcing “activists” and “human rights fronts” to shut down by exposing them,” it noted.Ironically, one such source of fake data, DOTO (Data of Database of the Oppressed), was cited by WaPo tech ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma in an article in January 2023 to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India.Turned out DOTO was full of fabrication & outright imagination. We exposed their fabrication, after which they first tried revising their data and later deleted and disappeared.DOTO met its fate in October this year and is no more among us. (RIP!)(12/n) pic.twitter.com/y55TrdzNWS‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. The OSINT handle also uncovered the lies of another dubious organisation called OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India), following which the latter shut shop permanently.But after our exposé they shut down OFMI, pulled down its website, deleted traces, and went into oblivion. Most of the activists associated with them have also removed all references to OFMI.(6/n) pic.twitter.com/uj0DRlnTkhThe leftist media outlet had reached out to prominent people in the hopes of deterring them from sharing informative posts by ‘Disinfo Lab’. The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma messaged American political commentator Jack Posobiec on Friday (8th December) and claimed that the Indian OSINT handle is run by an Intelligence officer.“We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab. Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he claimed. Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0He further added, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?“Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.After the article was published, The Washington Post did not reproduce the actual response of Jack Posobiec. While resorting to shrewd dishonesty, it wrote,” Posobiec did not address whether he was familiar with the organisation’s background.“With the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind, The Washington Post is leaving no stone unturned to make insinuations about the Modi government and target individuals and accounts known for debunking anti-India propaganda.The development comes amidst growing concerns about ‘regime change’ operations in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Just last month, The Washington Post published a misleading piece wherein it dubbed requests for action to X (formerly Twitter) against extemists by Indian government as ‘global standard for online censorship.’Earlier, it romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in Kashi.The Washington Post has also published a dubious report on India and its solar power systems. It has given editorial space to the likes of scam-accused ‘journalist’ Rana Ayyub to parrot the narrative of ‘Muslims are in danger in India.’None of these articles are random but serve a sinister agenda to create a narrative that paints the incumbent elected government as ‘anti-democracy’ and ‘anti-minority’.In the US, The Washington Post has attempted to distort public perceptions through its dissemination of the Russian disinformation hoax – A conspiracy theory that suggests that the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential election was influenced by Russia.It had also suppressed the ‘Hunter Biden Laptop’ story and influenced the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election. With less than 6 months left for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Indian public must be wary of attempts by Western publications to peddle their sinister agendaWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The dignity of the parliament house was breached on the night of 21st September when Ramesh Bidhuri abused me. Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.TMC’s Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha after the Ethics Committee tabled its report on her corruption and bribery. She was expelled after the tabled report was debated and a vote was sought from MPs. Soon after Mahua Moitra’s expulsion, the left-liberal ecosystem in politics and media started reacting with tears and rants. From BSP MP Danish Ali saying Gandhi must be weeping to so-called neutral journalists getting goosebumps, every reaction from this clout represented the meltdown they had after the action against the now-former TMC MP.Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali said, “What is this?

All principles of natural justice were clouted. BJP by animal majority voted a member out just because she spoke about industrialist Adani and his relations with Prime Minister Modi.”TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, “They tried to suppress the voice of opposition. Would not you listen to the one who is accused of so many severe allegations? This never happens. Parties of the I.N.D.I. alliance came together against this decision. It is a huge day for us.”Following the expulsion, Mahua Moitra, known for her tedious and boorish monologues in the parliament, launched another noisy rant outside the Parliament as an ex-MP. Speaking to the media with Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi standing behind her, Mahua Moitra screamed that there was no evidence of any cash or any gifts being taken by her. She even brazened out sharing her login credentials with Darshan Hiranandani, stating that there is no rule specified against sharing login credentials. She then shouted that an MP sharing her credentials with a businessman so that he could pose questions targeted at his rival business entity is not wrong, because MPs are there to raise questions on behalf of the public anyway. Resharing the video of her rant on X, Arfa Khanum Sherwani quoted her sentences and said that she got goosebumps to see Mahua Moitra speak like that. Sherwani posted, “I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you. Goosebumps!”I am 49 years old.

Shameful.”Without due process and being given a chance to defend herself #MahuaMoitra is expelled. ShamefulNotably, Mahua Moitra was given a fair opportunity to present her side in front of the ethics committee of the parliament. However, the left-liberal ecosystem kept spreading the lie that she was denied a chance to defend herself. This is because Mahua Moitra reportedly requested to speak on behalf of her party during the discussion after the report of the committee was tabled in the house, but she was denied.India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted from his X handle, “So a 104-page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs having even a chance to read the report in any detail and respond. No cross-examination of key witness Darshan Hiranandani. Natural justice anyone? When the issue is as serious as the expulsion of an MP, surely there is a need for a fair hearing and due process, no? Think.”So a 104 page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at 12 noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled.

Hiranandani has admitted to paying cash, lavish gifts to Moitra, and having access to her Lok Sabha login credentials.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing.

It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 - 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi has become one of the top pilgrimage spots in India as a record 12.92 crore devotees visited the holy shrine in two years. Notably, the expanded Kashi Vishwanath Dham will soon complete its two years on 13th December. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor on 13th December 2021, and since then, the number of devotees of Mahadev has increased manifold. The official added that the number is soon expected to breach the 13 crore mark. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the temple trust, Sunil Kumar Verma said, “Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham was inaugurated on 13 December 2021. From then till 6 December 2023, more than 12 crore, 92 lakh and 24 thousand devotees have taken darshan of Baba. By the end of December, this number is expected to cross 13 crore.”During the auspicious month of Shrawan and other special occasions and festivals, a huge influx of devotees throng the temple premises. As per the official data, during the months of Shrawan alone, more than 1.6 crore devotees visited the temple. This year, because of Adhik maas, the Sawan month was 59 days long. In July, the temple saw a footfall of over 72 lakh devotees and the number increased to 95.6 lakh in August.

He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ","Mohit Pandey to be the chief priest of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: While the leftist ecosystem is linking it with caste, here is why...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohit-pandey-caste-ram-mandir-leftist-ecosystem/,"Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. The process of selecting priests to perform prayers at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was recently completed. As part of the process, regular applications were invited from interested devotees, and around 3000 people participated. The interested parties had to undergo a rigorous selection process that included specific criteria for choosing the priests for the Ram Mandir. In this entire process, 200 applicants were interviewed, out of which 50 candidates were selected for the post of priests.Subsequently, the reports saying that Mohit Pandey had been selected as the chief priest went viral on social media. Reacting to these reports, certain social media users tried to cast aspersions and raise questions over the selection process for priests asking why only a Brahmin was selected for this post.Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. A Dalit portal named ‘The Mooknayak’ tweeted in Hindi, ” Mohit Pandey will become the priest of Ram temple! Is it forbidden for Dalits to become priests?” ""राम मंदिर के पुजारी बनेंगे मोहित पांडे!""– क्या दलितों का पुजारी बनना मना है? pic.twitter.com/aZRstoJcA0Dilip Mandal fumed and wrote, “This temple is being built by the Government of India as a trust. It is not anyone’s ancestral property. There should be an agitation if the reservation is not given in the temple management. Everyone will give Dakshina and only one caste will withdraw all the money, this will not work.” बहुत सही। वैसे भी ये मंदिर भारत सरकार का ट्रस्ट बना रहा है। किसी के बाप की संपत्ति नहीं है। मंदिर मैनेजमेंट में रिज़र्वेशन न दिया गया तो आंदोलन होना चाहिए। दक्षिणा सब देंगे और सिर्फ सारा पैसा एक जाति के लोग निकालेंगे, ये नहीं चलेगा। https://t.co/Rp2qUwV6BeAn X user named Suraj Yadav in a sarcastic tone claimed that Dalits, OBCs, and Tribals are not Hindus. He wrote, “If he is a Hindu then he is selected. Keep in mind that Dalits, backward people, and tribals are not Hindus. Shudras, Ati Shudras, and people outside the caste system have no place either in the trust or in the place of worship. And this is especially for those Yadavs who are supporters of Manuvad or Brahminism.”हिन्दू है तो चयनित हुआ। दलित, पिछड़े, आदिवासी हिन्दू नहीं हैं, यह ध्यान रहे। शूद्र, अति शूद्र, जाति प्रथा से बाहर लोगों को न तो ट्रस्ट में स्थान है और न ही पूजा स्थल में। और यह उन यादवों के लिए ख़ास तौर से जो मनुवाद या ब्राह्मणवाद के समर्थक हैं। #SC_ST_OBC #ईवीएम_हटाओ… pic.twitter.com/RadVOwhiK9However, the pertinent thing is that those who are casting aspersions, neither know about the selection process nor are they aware of the merit due to which Mohit Pandey was selected for the post of Chief Priest.For those unversed, the necessary condition to become a priest in the Ramlala temple was that the candidate should have studied Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit from a recognised Gurukul. Additionally, the candidate must have been initiated into the Ramanandiya tradition. In line with that, attention was paid to the knowledge of Vedas, rituals, and Vedic mantras during the interview process to select priests for the Ram Mandir. The upper limit for the candidates was fixed at 30 years.Furthermore, despite their selection as Priest and Chief Priest, the selected candidates will have to undergo a long training period, which would last for 6 months, before they start performing their duties. In this training phase, they will be imparted in-depth knowledge of Vedas, rituals, Vedic mantras, and Ramayana. Only after the training phase is over, the priests will be able to perform the worship of Ramlala.As per the selection criteria, it was necessary to be a scholar of the Ramnandiya tradition, as well as to have expertise in the knowledge of Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit. The fact that Mohit Pandey passed all the selection criteria based on merit and ability, just like other candidates who were also evaluated, means that allegations of casteism and religious favoritism don’t arise. Notably, Mohit Pandey studied for seven years at Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth, Ghaziabad. He obtained a Shastri (Bachelor) degree from Sri Venkateswara Vedic University, affiliated with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in Tirupati. In 2023, he earned a master’s degree in Samaveda. He is also a scholar of the Ramanandiya tradition and possesses expertise in Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Likewise, other selected priests include youth from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. All the selected priests belong to the Ramanandiya tradition and have expertise in the Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Speaking with The New Indian Express, Professor Rani Sadashiva Murthy, Vice-Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara Vedic University expressed happiness over the selection of Mohit Pandey to the post of Chief Priest of Shri Ram Lal Temple. Murthy said, “Many students from the University serve as priests and acharyas in various temples. A soft-spoken person, Pandey’s nature, focus and dedication to his studies have earned him the opportunity to serve Lord Ram in the esteemed Ayodhya Ram mandir.”Mohit Pandey’s journey, from Ghaziabad to Tirupati and now Ayodhya after being selected as the Chief Priest of Ram Lala, is a testament to his dedication and rigorous training. Institutions like Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth and Sri Venkateswara Vedic University in Ghaziabad have played a crucial role in nurturing individuals with spiritual abilities, as evidenced by their selection process.In such a situation, those who are pointing fingers at his selection and linking it with castism are vitiating society by fanning the caste divide. While the ecosystem has been carrying out smear campaigns and cast aspersions, it is important to highlight that there are several temples in different states of India, there are not only Dalit or Women priests, prayers are performed by Dalit women priests in these temples.In a previous article, OpIndia highlighted temples in which women and Dalits have been performing the responsibility of priests.

"10 December, 2023 ","Old video of Bengali singer, highlighting selective outrage of Muslims, goes viral: Read details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/old-clipped-viral-video-muslim-hypocrisy-poem-hindus-in-bangladesh/,"While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards.A week ago, a video of a woman highlighting the silence of Bangladeshi Muslims over the atrocities committed against Hindus in the Islamic Republic went viral on X (formerly Twitter).A user named ‘SK Chakraborty(@sanjoychakra)’ posted the video on the micro-blogging platform on 3rd December, which had since garnered 1.79 lakh views. The video was shared over 1800 times and was liked by 3500 users.‘Sk Chakraborty’ informed that he did not know about the identity of the woman, who had conveyed the pain of the Hindu community and the hypocrisy of militant Muslims in the form of a melodious poem. This gutsy H woman in her melodius voice sings about Hindu oppression bringing out the pain of Hindus and hypocricy of M. Militant M.. are inciting communal riots across Facebook. She shouldn’t face the fate of Kanhaiyalal.Rough translation- “Free loader, son of M. Your tears… pic.twitter.com/Rwdr2iF8eXWith the help of our sources, OpIndia was able to ascertain the identity of the woman as Indian Bengali singer Mousumi Hossain. She is a native of Barasat, located in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. At the time of writing, Mousumi had 7.1K followers on Facebook. After closely listening to the lyrics in the video, OpIndia was able to find a transcript of the poem that was uploaded on the website ‘Kobita Cocktail in 2019. The name of the poet was mentioned as Akhtaruzzaman Azad.We found that Azad is a Dhaka-based author and has more than 1.12 lakh followers on Facebook. It became clear that he indeed wrote the poem in the context of Bangladesh, although Indian singer Mousumi Hossain featured in the viral video. On further digging into the matter, OpIndia was able to trace the video on the timeline of Akhtaruzzaman Azad. The video was posted on 29th June last year.In the caption, the poet informed that the name of the poem is ‘Awoj Abar Tolo’ which loosely translates to ‘Raise Your Voice now.’ The poem deals with the subject of religious extremism and selective outrage by various religious denominations (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists). Each stanza, barring the last and penultimate, is dedicated to the antics of followers of each Faith.The poet Akhtaruzzaman Azad calls upon society to shed religious differences, stop the bloodshed and see the goodness in one another. The poem has been recited like a song by singer Mousumi Hossain. It must be mentioned that only the first stanza of the poem (and not the entirety of it), concerning the hypocrisy of Muslims living in Bangladesh, has been going viral on social media.In that particular stanza, the poet highlights how believers in Allah (Mumin) are willing to cry their hearts out on learning about murders in Palestine or the plight of Rohingyas in Myanmar. He emphasises how Muslims are ever-ready to wail about ‘saving Gaza’ but have no tears to shed for Hindus dying in Bangladesh. The poem brings out the distinction in this selective ‘concern for humanity.’ –In the first stanza, the poet highlights how the Muslim community screams over the death of someone named ‘Malik or Khalik ‘ but does not even whisper for a deceased named ‘Naresh or Paresh’.While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards. He talks about the behavioural patterns of followers of other Faiths such as Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism in the second, third and fourth stanzas.In the end, he the poet makes an appeal for peace among different factions of the society.Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the 1-year-old video is going viral on social media. Given that the poem by Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions the selective silence of the Muslim community in Bangladesh (in the first stanza), which perfectly fits a pattern in the Islamic world, it is gaining traction among netizens. বাংলাদেশে বিবেক এখনো বেঁচে আছে। আমার প্রণাম নিন। আখতারুজ্জামান আজাদের কবিতা–""এই যে তুমি মস্ত মুমিন, মুসলমানের ছেলে;বক্ষ ভাসাও, ফিলিস্তিনে খুনের খবর পেলে।রোহিঙ্গাদের দুঃখে তুমি এমন কাঁদা কাঁদো;ভাসাও পুরো আকাশ-পাতাল, ভাসাও তুমি চাঁদও!অশ্রু তোমার তৈরি থাকে— স্বচ্ছ এবং তাজা;Ex-Governor of Meghalaya, Tathagatha Roy, shared the poem on X (formerly Twitter) on 1st November, 2023.The video is equally popular on Facebook amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Where is the money – What happens to the cash recovered by Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax department during raids,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/what-happens-to-cash-recovered-during-ed-raids-cbi-income-tax/,"First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Income Tax (IT) Department conduct multiple raids every year, resulting in the recovery of unaccounted cash worth crores. With swanky photographs of seized money arranged to form letters like “E” and “D” to denote ED during raids, the question arises: What happens to the cash recovered by the agencies during raids?When the ED, CBI, or IT Department seizes unaccounted money, they cannot just keep it on their office premises. First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The actual process of seizing the cash starts from here. The State Bank of India is called in to count the seized cash. Simultaneously, a list of seized cash is prepared with the details of the recovered amount in specific denominations such as Rs 500, Rs 200, Rs 100, Rs 50 and so on. Based on the amount, the bank deploys multiple cash counting machines to ensure smooth and quick completion of the counting process.Once the counting is complete, the cash is sealed in the boxes in the presence of independent witnesses. The cash is then taken to the SBI branch, where it is deposited under the agency’s Personal Deposit (PD) account. Later, the cash is moved to the central government’s treasury.Notably, cash can be used only once the case is over in the court of law. Neither the ED, nor the bank, nor the government has the right to use the money for any purposes while the case is sub-judice. The agency issues a provisional attachment order, and an adjudicating authority must confirm the attachment within six months. This order ensures that the accused cannot benefit from the seized cash. Notably, the agency can only hold onto the cash for 180 days. During that time, the agency has to prove the validity of the seizure. In case the agency fails to do so, the money gets returned to the accused automatically.How the money will be used depends on the outcome of the case. If the accused acquits, the cash gets returned; otherwise, if convicted, the money becomes government property.Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Income Tax Department can raid, investigate and seize property in cases of money laundering, scams, tax fraud, or irregularities.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Who is Dhiraj Prasad Sahu – The Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand at the centre of the historic Income Tax raid,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dhiraj-prasad-sahu-rajya-sabha-mp-jharkhand-it-raid/,"Dhiraj Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the Indian National Congress, the grand old party, is once again surrounded by controversies. The party has yet to recover from the crushing defeat in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections. It is now facing intense scrutiny as the Income Tax (IT) Department has recovered hundreds of crores of unaccounted cash from properties linked to its Jharkhand Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu.By 9th December, the IT Department recovered nearly Rs 300 crores from the premises linked to Sahu, and further recovery is still underway. Congress Party officially distanced itself from the controversy and claimed it had nothing to do with the cash recovered by the IT Department. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Congress party’s General Secretary in Communications, Jairam Ramesh, claimed that the Indian National Congress has nothing to do with the businesses run by its Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand. The senior Congress functionary added that only the accused in the case, Sahu, could explain the source for vast piles of cash reportedly seized from his properties and demanded an explanation from Sahu.The money recovered by the IT department is said to be linked to Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Private Limited and its related organisations, where Sahu is a partner. Over nineteen bags containing cash were taken from the home of a certain Bunty Sahu, who was assigned to oversee the management of liquor facilities in the Odisha regions. Three dozen machines were deployed to count the cash. Reports suggest some of the machines broke down during counting, resulting in a delay in completing the process. Reportedly, Bhagat Beherea, the Regional Manager of the State Bank of India in Bolangir, said that the bank had received 176 bags containing money in total. Fifty workers and twenty-five counting machines have been deployed to count the currency notes.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner in Baldev Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd, a group company of Budha Distilleries. He has been a Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand since 2009. Sahu’s family has been linked to Congress for a long time.Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Slowly and steadily, he climbed the party ladder and served as office-bearer in the Lohardaga district and later in the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee.In 2009, he was elected Rajya Sabha member for the first time in a bypoll. He was re-elected for the second term in 2010. In May 2018, he became the third time Rajya Sabha member of Congress from Jharkhand.According to his profile on the Rajya Sabha website, his family has been associated with Congress since independence. He was part of “Jail Bharo Aandolan” in 1978. He has asked 630 questions in Rajya Sabha since 2010, with the latest being related to the Kavach Safety System, procurement of paddy, losses due to damage to national highways, accidents in coal mines, privatisation of airports and more.In November 2022, Sahu participated in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, yet another attempt of the Congress Party to “launch” Gandhi into politics and project him as Prime Minister candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. In a post on X, Dhiraj Sahu shared some photographs from the Yatra.भारत जोड़ो यात्रा के दौरान कुछ पल।#BharatJodoYatra@bharatjodo @INCIndia @INCJharkhand pic.twitter.com/g3lYQSRoBkLater, in February 2023, Sahu published a video from the Yatra and wrote, “Historic Bharat Jodo Yatra ended up winning the hearts of Indians.

Whatever has been looted from the public, every penny will have to be returned, this is Modi’s guarantee.” देशवासी इन नोटों के ढेर को देखें और फिर इनके नेताओं के ईमानदारी के 'भाषणों' को सुनें… 😂😂😂जनता से जो लूटा है, उसकी पाई-पाई लौटानी पड़ेगी, यह मोदी की गारंटी है। ❌❌❌💵 💵 💵❌❌❌ pic.twitter.com/O2pEA4QTOjSpeaking to Times Now, BJP leader Nishikant Dubey said, “The Congress leader is a partner in the two companies that are being raided. I feel the Income Tax department should transfer the case to the Enforcement Directorate considering the magnanimity of the situation.” In a post on X, he wrote, “The Rajya Sabha MP of Congress, Dhiraj Sahu, is declared as a partner in two companies, Baldev Sahu & Company and Shiv Prasad Sahu & Sons, whose shares have been accounted for at Rs 350 crores till now. The disclosure of 20 per cent of these shares is pending, and it is suspected to be undisclosed or benami, which will be revealed through an investigation. A raid at his residences in Ranchi and Lohardaga resulted in the recovery of Rs 20 crore in cash and assets, including gold, silver, and diamonds worth Rs 150 crore.

"12 December, 2023 ",First-time MLA and four-time state General Secretary Bhajan Lal Sharma: BJP signals organisational importance in choosing new CM for Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-rajasthan-general-secretary-bhajan-lal-sharma-cm/,"He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the CM-designate of Rajasthan. Further, his appointment is seen as a major deviation from the general political trend. Usually, seniority and political growth had been adjudged by the number of times a leader has been elected to the state assembly or Lok Sabha. 56-year-old Bhajan Lal Sharma is a first-time MLA. He completed his MA (politics) from Rajasthan University, Jaipur, in 1993.He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The BJP had fielded him after denying a ticket to the sitting MLA Ashok Lahoti. However, Sharma, a resident of Bharatpur, is said to have a strong hold on organisational politics. Before plunging into electoral politics, he had been working in the organisation for a long time. Bhajan Lal Sharma has been playing an important part in BJP’s organisational structure in Rajasthan. He has served as the state general secretary for the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. Previously, he had been associated with RSS and ABVP. For this reason, he is considered close to the party’s ideological mentor RSS, and party chief JP Nadda.The three major announcements on three consecutive days have signalled that the organisational importance played a major role in these major selections. A key similarity in these decisions has been the history of these leaders in serving various organisational roles and strengthening the party’s cadre in these states. Apart from Sharma, Dr. Mohan Yadav, the new CM-designate of Madhya Pradesh had held several organisational posts in BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. Yadav, who started student politics at Madhav Science College, and held many positions in the party. In 1982, he was the co-secretary of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union and in 1984, he was the President of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union.Mohan Yadav assumed the responsibility of Municipal Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Ujjain) in the year 1984 and Department Head in 1986. In the year 1988, Yadav was the state co-secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Madhya Pradesh) and a member of the national executive. He was the State Minister of the State Unit of the Council in 1989-90 and the National Minister of the Council in the year 1991-92. In 1993-95, he served as the functionary (Sangh Karyavah) of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Ujjain Nagar. Additionally, his appointment was also seen as a major signal of political empowerment for the Yadav community, a dominant political force in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, have lacked proper proportional representation owing to the family-oriented politics of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Similarly, Vishnu Deo Sai, the next CM-designate of Chhattisgarh held the top organisational post in BJP’s Chhattisgarh unit. He served as Chhattisgarh BJP President from 2006 to 2013. His appointment also signalled a strong empowerment for the tribal community which was earlier witnessed when BJP-led NDA picked Droupadi Murmu for the Presidential post.   With all these new appointments, BJP signals that its motto ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (inclusivity) will be counter to the opposition’s push for caste census and proportional representation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Center redefines terrorism in new criminal code, includes actions that threaten India’s economic security: Report ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/center-redefines-terrorism-includes-actions-threatens-india-economic-security/,"The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionaryOn 12th December (Tuesday), the Union government revamped the legal definition of “a terrorist act”. Any action threatening India’s economic security will be treated as a ‘terrorist act’ under the new criminal code. The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionary, as reported by NDTV.#NewCriminalCode pic.twitter.com/g30k36MjeIAccording to Section 113 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, those who threaten, or are likely to threaten, the country by causing “damage to the monetary stability of India, by way of production or smuggling or circulation of counterfeit Indian paper currency…” commit a terrorist act.Notably, on 11th December, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had notified Lok Sabha that the three criminal law bills would be withdrawn. He added that the bills would be replaced with three new bills to incorporate the recommendations proposed by a parliamentary committee. Pertinent to note that the revised versions of all three were tabled in the Lok Sabha this evening (12th December).A Statement from the office of the Home Minister had said, “The bill (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, and Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita) was referred to Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs on August 18 for consideration. The Committee held several rounds of discussion with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, domain experts, and various stakeholders and submitted its reports along with recommendations on November 10.”Apart from revamping the definition of terrorist act, the government has added two new sections to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It is one of three bills that is now slated to replace current criminal laws, including the Code of Criminal Procedure. As per media reports, the first addition is the inclusion of Section 86. This newly added section includes harming a woman’s mental health in its definition of “cruelty”. Section 85 provided a three-year jail term for a husband, or members of his family, found guilty of subjecting his wife to cruel treatment in the previous version of the bill. However, the previous version didn’t define “cruel treatment” which has now been included, and the definition, significantly, extends to harming the woman’s mental health as well as her physical well-being. The second section prescribes a two-year imprisonment for disclosing the identity of a sexual assault victim from court proceedings without their consent.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",K Annamalai slams temple management and HR&CE over attack on Sabarimala devotees at Tamil Nadu’s Srirangam temple,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/k-annamalai-slams-temple-management-and-hrce-over-attack-on-sabarimala-devotees-at-srirangam-temple/,"Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.On 12th December (Tuesday), temple management staff and police allegedly manhandled and assaulted devotees in the Trichy Srirangam Temple premises, in Tamil Nadu. The injured Ayyappa devotees have been admitted to Srirangam Government Hospital for treatment. Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.Several devotees, including Andhra Ayyappa Bakhtar Chenna Rao, were assaulted. Following this, Ayyappa devotees filed a police complaint against three temporary employees Selvam, Vignesh, and Bharat who are accused of assaulting the devotees as well as against the temple administration. As per reports, it is alleged that the police deployed in the temple premises, instead of supporting the assaulted Ayyappa devotees, supported the accused temple staff. They reportedly pushed the injured devotees out of the temple and tried to cover up the attack. Subsequently, more than a hundred Ayyappa devotees protested at places like Karthikai Gopuram and Flagpole against the assault on devotees and mismanagement. However, the police reportedly stopped Ayyappa devotees who were protesting. A video footage of the incident is going viral on social media which has created a stir among the devotees. Sharing the video of an injured Ayyappa devotee, BJP state president K Annamalai condemned the incident. He also launched a scathing attack on temple management authorities including Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR & CE). Annamalai asserted that a government that doesn’t believe in Hindu dharma has no business to oversee or control the management of Hindu temples. Taking to X, he wrote, “A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples. The Iyyappa devotees who have had 42 days of Vrath, with all devotion, wanted to pray to Ranganatha Swamy after their return from Sabarimala. The Iyyappa devotees questioned the long wait in the queue and special treatment to a select few who were assaulted near the sanctum sanctorum & which resulted in bloodshed inside the Temple premises.”  A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples.

Tamil Nadu BJP’s Trichy district unit will today hold a protest outside the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy Temple against the TN HR&CE department, demanding the strictest action against those spoiling the sanctity of the Temple.” Meanwhile, Ayyappa devotees and opposition parties have been accusing the state governments of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. Apart from Tamil Nadu, in Kerala, the opposition leaders have alleged that the Kerala Police have been diverted to ensure the statewide trip of CM Pinnrayi Vijayan rather than providing adequate police security for management and crowd control at Sabarimala pilgrimage. The devotees have been waiting for more than 20 hours in long queues. Several videos are doing rounds on the internet in which devotees have highlighted mismanagement for this year’s Sabarimala pilgrimage. In many cases, the police and temple management authorities have manhandled devotees for highlighting these issues. Reportedly, the devotees are facing an acute shortage of basic amenities like clean water and food, and one 11-year-old girl child died.  Fate of Ayyappa Devotees in Kerala !!!As u all know sabarimala pilgrimage is a significant annual Hindu pilgrimage in Kerala attracting millions of devotees.

Another feature is the pilgrims from other states coming under duress from the police force. The Vijayan government is now showing its anger towards the believers for their combined efforts to ensure all the religious protocols in place in Sabarimala are intact, which they got from the court. Vijayan government has to change its attitude and ensure all facilities are there for the pilgrims.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ","Antisemitism is not new to US campuses including Ivy Leagues, their credibility is questionable for more reasons than one. Here’s why",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/antisemitism-not-new-to-us-campuses-their-credibility-questionable/,"While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A mix of Georgian and Victorian-era inspired academic buildings are spread across the Northeastern United States. Besides the entitled exclusivity in the admissions process, the unreasonable fee structure and the decorated syllabus, there is also a sadistic appeal to the Gothic appearance these institutions boast of.But, to quote Shakespeare, all that glitters is not gold.The holier-than-thou attitude over the decades of US’s Ivy Leagues – touted as the world’s most esteemed and prestigious universities – was brought to its knees when presidents of two of the three universities, Harvard and Penn, and the third being the high-ranking MIT, refused to condemn calls for genocide of Jews at a congressional hearing on 5th December.On 5th December, a congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” was held in Washington, D.C.At the hearing, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Her specific yes or no question to them was, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate your university’s rules or code of conduct regarding bullying or harassment?”MIT President Sally Kornbluth responded saying that “if targeted at individuals and not making public statements”. When asked for a yes or no answer, Kornbluth said that she has not heard calls for the genocide of Jews on MIT campus.The Congresswoman questioned, “But you have chants for intifada?” To this, Kornbluth replied, “I have heard chants which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination of the Jewish people.”She said that such calls would be investigated as harassment only “if pervasive and severe”.President (now former) of University of Pennsylvania, Liz Magill’s response came with wide smiles and smirks. She said, “If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes.”When questioned again, Magill said that if such speech is directed and severe and pervasive, it is harassment. When asked if she means a yes, Magill said it is a context-dependent decision.She maintained that “if the speech becomes conduct, it is harassment”. Magill finally responded with a yes after much struggle. President of Harvard, Dr Claudine Gay reiterated the same chorus in answer to the question.“It (the call for genocide of Jews) can be (violate rules) depending on the context,” Dr Gay said. When asked what the context is she said, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual.”“Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action,” Dr Gay said.The roughly 3 minute 31 second long video of the hearing took social media by the storm prompting angry responses from netizens. The matter has escalated with key stakeholders demanding accountability from the presidents of the respective universities.President Liz Magill of University of Penn has resigned amid mounting pressure.The focus of the hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was the rise in cases of antisemitism reported on campuses across the US and the universities’ response to the same.This comes in the backdrop of the 7th October terrorist attack by Palestinian group Hamas on Israel killing at least 1,400 people and kidnapping more than 200 to Gaza. Israel has since vowed to avenge the death of its people and has launched an all-out offensive against the terrorist group.A selective support for Palestinians toeing the Hamas line has since mushroomed in campuses across the United States. In the name of human rights of Palestinians, the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been justified on the campuses of these so-called prestigious institutions with absolutely no repercussions from the administration.On 11th October, four days after the brutal attack on Israel, a group of Harvard students submitted a letter in support of Palestine. This prompted several corporate institutions, particularly those with Jewish heads, warning Harvard that they will not hire students supporting Hamas. Several Jewish donors to the universities also threatened to withdraw their donations.On 25th October, Jewish students at Cooper Union college in New York had to be locked inside library for their own safety as pro-Palestinian students tried to break down the door chanting “Free Palestine”. The Jewish students had to be escorted out through tunnels using the back door.On 18th October, a “Stop the genocide in Gaza” die-in demonstration was reportedly organised by the Harvard Business School. A video from the demonstration showed a Jewish student mobbed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators screaming “shame, shame, shame”.On 24th October, an antisemitic slogan was displayed on the wall of the library of George Washington University. It read, “Free Palestine From The River To The Sea.” Another message read, “Glory to our martyrs” and one read, “End the siege on Gaza”.While several academic institutes across America, both Ivy League and, public and private, saw a dramatic rise in hostility against Jewish students, these have turned out to be symptoms of an underlying disease.A complaint letter via e-mail by the Jewish rights group ‘Brandeis Center’ to the University of Pennsylvania alleged that the latter had allowed its campus to become a hostile environment for Jewish students and a magnet for antisemites.It pointed to a festival that was organised by the university titled “Palestine Writes Festival” which hosted antisemitic speakers. Notably, this festival came days before the terrorist attacks proving the antisemitism is pre-existing sentiment on campuses in the US.The letter read, “In the days leading up to the September Festival, anti-Semitic graffiti and a Penn student’s violent attack on Penn’s Hillel signaled trouble to come for Jewish students and institutions on campus.”Surprisingly, the festival was organised on the same day as the Jewish festival ‘Jewish High Holy Days of Awe”. Meanwhile, Magill, despite concerns raised by several members, stood by the event citing “free speech”.Even now, as recently as 9th December (Saturday), Jewish students in the Penn University are being subjected to chants like “We are Hamas” whereas openly antisemitic professors and staff are still employed with the university.Forget even the recent decades, antisemitism on US campuses goes back nearly a century. In the 1950s, Stanford University reportedly tried to limit the proportion of its Jewish students.Stanford University is located on the West Coast of the US and is not an Ivy League university but ranks higher than Ivy League varsities.Another report reveals that the Seth Low Junior College (SLJC) near the Columbia University was “created with the explicit goal of reducing the amount of Jewish students on the CU campus”. It was built in the early 20th century.As per the report, the “enrollment of Jewish students at Columbia College after Seth Low Junior College’s opening dropped from 40 to 25 per cent”. Moreover, on one hand, half of the total Columbia College applicants were accepted, only one in six Jewish applicants were admitted in the early 20th century.This was reportedly the case in most East Coast schools in the US.One might think that on-campus antisemitism is an elephantine problem which dwarfs any other controversies surrounding academic campuses in America.Not really. The political invasion of campuses in America which is being exposed with hatred for Jews and Israel has only compounded their already declining credibility.The larger-than-life projected image of these institutions in the US has been a facade which has been maintained through endowments, donations and charities flowing in like dirt, open political biases, crippling admissions fees thereby giving academic access to only a handful, racial and gender persecution, and woke agendas.You’d be surprised, if not shocked, to know that it was only in June this year that the US Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer determine race as grounds for admissions.Up till the US SC verdict, race was still very much a part of the admissions process in the United States centered around the idea of “positive discrimination”.And yet, the move was decried by the left-liberal media in the US as the end of “affirmative action”.Racism has been rampant, like a regular petty crime, on US campuses including the so-called esteemed campuses. This has only served to fan left wing politics in the US where voices are raised prominently when incidents involve a black victim.But when Asian or Indian students are subjected to racism, the same woke left wing crowd goes into hiding. Safe to say, US campuses are not merely dealing with crimes of unabated racism but several politicised versions of it.In 2020, Princeton University had acknowledged that systemic racism exists on its campus following which an investigation was launched by the Trump administration.Columbia University graduate Emma Sulkowicz made headlines in 2015 by staging a protest based on performance art against alleged sexual harassment.Sulkowicz walked around the campus carrying a 50-pound mattress and across the stage during her graduation to symbolise the weight carried around by victims of sexual assault.She had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by a classmate of rape during her sophomore year in 2013. The accused was cleared of the charges following a hearing by the university.In 2017, three professors in Dartmouth’s department of psychological and brain sciences were accused of sexual abuse and misconduct. The professors reportedly resigned or retired following recommendations for dismissal.However, the seven women who levelled the charges alleged that the college had failed to protect its students from sexual harassment and sexual assault.A scandal broke out in Cornell University last year exposing alleged incidents of sexual assault and druggings at off-campus fraternity parties. A crime alert was issued early in November 2022 by the campus police responding to four different reports of students being drugged and at least once case of sexual assault.In May 2022, a longtime professor at Princeton named Joshua Katz was suspended after investigation revealed that he had sex with one of his undergraduate students years ago.In 2021, several complaints surfaced against the professor from mid-2000s alleging disturbing cases of allegedly propositioning undergraduates for sexual relationships.In 1986, a shocking scandal was uncovered in Brown University wherein students were allegedly linked to a sex worker ring in Providence. Multiple students were charged with sex work crimes and drug possession.According to The Washington Post, Harvard in 2022 warned all undergraduate students that “cisheterosexism,” “fatphobia” and “using the wrong pronouns” amounted to “abuse” and perpetuated “violence” on campus.In May this year, the student government at the Northwestern University in Illinois “indefinitely” froze the funds of the College Republicans over an event poster showing conservative speaker James Lindsay, critical of transgenderism.After an uproar that has been dragging in the US over participation of trans athletes in women’s sports, a bill was approved by the House Republicans in April this year barring such transgender athletes whose biological sex awas assigned at birth as male from competing on girls’ or women’s sports teams.As if the use of a thousand pronouns for individually-preferred “gender” identification has not disadvantaged academically-focused students enough, transgenders participating against females in sports has most definitely put the latter at a physical disadvantage.High-profile names involving celebrities and politicians and their aides were at the center of a massive admissions scandal across universities.College athletics coaches and test administrators accepted bribes and donations in exchange for recruiting students. The mastermind, William Rick Singer, was paid a whopping $25 million by celebrity parents to bribe coaches and university administrators to designate their children as purported athletic recruits to facilitate their admission.Singer allegedly created fake charities to facilitate money for “donations” to various colleges including Yale University, Georgetown, Stanford and the University of Southern California.The big names involved in the scandal include Lori Loughlin, Felicity Huffman, Mossimo Giannulli, William H Macy, Michelle Janavs and many more. One of the more prominent names is Gordon Ernst, former Georgetown University tennis coach known for having coached the Obamas.In 2022, a professor at Columbia University, Michael Thaddeus, published a paper accusing the varsity of manipulating data to project that it spent more on research and instruction than it actually did.This, reportedly, in turn is suspected to have played a role in the Ivy League institution’s jump in the rankings. The university later admitted that they had reported incorrect data but refused to admit that it was done to improve rankings.As per the professor’s report, the varsity’s rankings moved up from no. 18 in 1988 to no 2 by 2022. Following the controversy, Columbia, Yale and Harvard announced that they would no longer participate in the rankings in the future.The rise of wokeism on university campuses in US can easily be attributed to left-wing bias. In fact, it can be considered a branch of the same tree.According to a poll, Republicans have the least amount of confidence (19%) in higher education in the United States whereas Democrats have the highest level of confidence at 59%.Another related survey reportedly found that 77% of college presidents in the US agree that the perception of colleges as intolerant of conservative views has impacted people’s attitudes about higher education.According to a report, US universities have been receiving funding from Qatar particularly in the period between 2001 and 2021, “precisely after the September 11 attacks”.As per the report based on a study published in 2022, a staggering $4.7 billion was injected into universities in the United States. Moreover, the recipients did not report part of the money received as required by the law.“Qatar has reportedly become the largest foreign donor to American academic in the two decades since 9/11,” the report reads.In 2020, the Trump administration alleged that top US universities have “massively underreported” foreign funding from China, Russia and other nations described as “foreign adversaries”.According to another report, Saudi Arabia owned oil company ARAMCO has been funding programmes in US universities like Princeton since as early as the 1950s. Moreover, Middle East studies programme in US institutions reportedly receive specifically from Arab countries to “advance their political agendas”.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the Saudis have seen such donations as a way to acquire goodwill, legitimacy and support in U.S. academia,” the report quotes NYU professor Zachary Lockman. Interestingly, it must be noted that some of the biggest names like George Soros and the Rothschilds, which bestow donations in billions to the US acadmia, are Jewish. And it is thus a wonder as to how these institutions, funded equally well by the left-liberal globalist disruptors like their Middle Eastern counterparts, have been unable to counter antisemitism. Yet, when questions are raised against these conglomerates, they coin the term antisemitism through their rights groups and NGOs in their defence.All in all, Universities in the US are too good to be true for their realities have been exposed for all to see since a long time. It is time to stop trusting every colonial infrastructure just because they put on a good show of elitist exclusivity. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"7 December, 2023 ","How The Hindu consoled itself and shielded Rahul Gandhi after electoral drubbing in 3 states: Blaming regional leaders, voters, Hindutva and more",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/the-hindu-shields-rahul-gandhi-electoral-loss-3-states-regional-leaders-voters-hindutva/,"The Gandhi family must realise how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is praiseworthy! By now, we are all used to the Congress party leaders crediting the Gandhi family for victories and blaming the regional leaders for their defeats. It is understandable why they are forced to do this. However, it is baffling that certain newspapers, that claim to be brave, daring, unbiased and whatnot, also willingly resorted to this same argument. Just to shield the Gandhi family.The Congress party lost in Rajasthan (RJ), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG) in the just concluded elections to these states. The Hindu, in a great show of loyalty towards the Gandhi family, asks us – Did overconfident regional leaders in the Hindi heartland pay no heed to Congress top brass?We are told by the author that in these three states, “heavyweights took independent decisions often ignoring the high command”. Are we to seriously believe there are people in Congress who are capable of ignoring the Gandhi family and making decisions? The author cites the example of Kamal Nath cancelling an I.N.D.I Alliance meeting in Bhopal. Are we to believe that Rahul Gandhi had no role in the cancellation of such a meeting? However, in my opinion, the best argument by the author was about the CG election. He writes that “Though the AICC did replace over 20 MLAs to beat anti-incumbency, Mr Baghel could not effectively counter the allegations of corruption against his government by the BJP”. Cute, no? The Gandhi family thought their job ended with replacing MLAs. The job of winning the narrative is on the CM only though. Imagine if Congress had won. The same author would have written how the Gandhi family played a master stroke by replacing 20 MLAs! This article is not the only place where The Hindu has given us pearls of wisdom. Their editorial on the results of these elections was even better! We have been told that the victory was because the BJP’s campaign was “laced with communal propaganda” and therefore “had a more effective outreach to subaltern segments”. I like the choice of phrase – subaltern segments. It’s a posh way of insulting the intelligence of the voters. In this particular case, The Hindu is arguing that the voter chose BJP’s communal agenda over Congress’s caste agenda. In its entire (long) editorial, The Hindu makes no mention of governance-based reasons on why the voters were vexed with Congress in RJ and CG where it was in power; and why they didn’t see Congress as an alternative in MP where BJP has been in power for nearly 2 decades now. We are told that Ashok Gehlot is so awesome that even though he lost the election he prevented a complete washout! And just in case you forgot that they told you that the BJP won because of Hindutva, they repeat it once again in their (long) editorial. This time, they accuse women, youth and tribal communities of falling prey to “Hindu identity politics”. I wonder what wrong the men did, to not get this honour! The editorial is severely upset that the caste census idea of Rahul Gandhi did not resonate with the voters. The editorial takes up a lot of space and conveys very little. When you separate the wheat from the chaff, it is baffling how The Hindu always ends up arguing that BJP’s victories are always because of Hindutva and nothing else really matters. How they try to find solace in the performance of the Congress party is also very touching. Their front-page banner story also highlighted how despite losing, they had their vote share intact! I hope the Gandhi family realises how faithful the editors and owners of The Hindu are towards them and make such great efforts to make them look good. The effort the writers at The Hindu put up in finding new phrases and words to describe their disgust towards the voters is really praiseworthy! They have been resorting to the same argument ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha victory changed the political landscape of India. It’s been more than 9 years, but they are yet to get out of the shock! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"6 December, 2023 ",31 years of Babri demolition: Remembering the Karsevaks who razed the face of adharma to the ground to pave the way for a Bhavya...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/babri-demolition-by-karsevaks-paved-the-way-for-ram-mandir-temple-in-ayodhya/,"While centuries of struggle to reclaim Dharma culminated in November 2019 when the Supreme Court of India handed over the encroached land in Ayodhya to Hindus, paving the way for the construction of a Bhavya Ram Mandir, the events that transpired on 6 December 1992 hold profound significance, for it manifested in the starkest form the passions and devotion of Karsevaks in wanting to liberate the birthplace of Lord Rama. Saryu Mata (the Holy river in Ayodhya) bears witness to the events and incidents of Ramayana in the Treta Yug to the reclamation of the Bhavya Ram Mandir in Ayodhya in the present day. She was the source for Bhagwan Ram, a reincarnation of Bhagwan Vishnu, and his devotees in Ayodhya to return to Vishnu Ji’s abode Vaikunth Dham.On 2nd November 1990, once again, albeit in shocking circumstances, the souls of Shri Ram’s devotees departed for Vaikunth right from the banks of Saryu. The Mulayam Singh-led UP Police had opened fire on a large group of kar sevaks who had come to Ayodhya to demand that the Babri structure be demolished and Ram Mandir be reconstructed.The Kothari brothers – Ram (23) and Sharad (20) Kothari – were the first ones to mount a Saffron flag atop the Babri controversial structure. A report filed on 3rd November 1990 in Jansatta said that an unidentified kar sevak from Sriganganagar, Rajasthan fell after being shot and as he fell, he wrote “Sitaram” on the road with his blood.It remains a mystery whether the Karsevak had written his name or was his devotion and adherence towards Lord Ram that made him write “Sitaram” in his own blood.The report mentioned that even after Karsevak fell to the ground, the CRPF personnel shot seven bullets into his skull.As per official figures, 16 kar sevaks were killed in cold blood. But actual numbers are believed to be much higher. Their only crime was that they staged peaceful demonstrations by expressing their religious reverence and singing bhajans.Little did they know that their act would send a wave across the country that would come right back to hit that very spot on 6th December 1992 for nothing and no one could soil the spirit of Ram Bhakts. 25 months later, on 6th December 1992, Hindus reminded the world once again that they hadn’t remotely been deterred in their fight for divine justice.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad organised a kar seva in Ayodhya in 1992 and an area was marked for worship on 6th December. Kar sevaks from across the country began to pour into Ayodhya in large numbers even as security personnel were deployed in equally large numbers.According to Mahant Brajmohan Das, who witnessed the demolition of the Babri structure on 6th December 1992, the birthplace of Shri Ram was filled with joy and enthusiasm. “Only those who were present in Ayodhya on that day can explain what God’s miracles and powers are,” he said.All arrangements including food, accommodation et cetera were made for thousands of devotees. “There seemed to be complete Ram Rajya in Ayodhya,” he said. Despite what ensued in 1990, the number of karsevaks visiting Ayodhya in 1992 and security personnel deployed was so large that the Mahant said that if the massacre was repeated, no one would come out alive.Finally, on 6th December 1992, a kar sevak entered an empty bus belonging to the security forces near Hanumangarhi and raced it towards the Babri structure shattering all barricades and paving the way for kar sevaks who followed.Call it divine intervention, the symbol of tyranny, savagery and bigotry was razed to dust that day; this formed the cornerstone of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. Kar sevaks cut the barbed wire barricading the Babri structure and climbed atop it.The three worn-out tombs of the Babri structure were brought down in less than 6 hours amid Holy chants of Shri Ram Jai Ram Jai Jai Ram. This was the first line of treatment for the wounded Hindu civilisation, all thanks and namans (bowing down) to the kar sevaks who risked their lives once again.Documentaries were made by the mainstream media to blot the image of kar sevaks, nat up sounds of Jai Shri Ram were played by the ecosystem of the day to push a narrative to demonise the Holy chant.Even as the Hindus, the kar sevaks removed the Babri structure from the face of the earth – as should be the case with every symbol of adharma (roughly translating to injustice) – we paid the price for it in the war of narratives that were to come.Hindus displayed to the world that when justice is delayed and denied when a civilisation seeking justice is brutalised and demonised, we will come to our own defence.Come to think of it, our patience knows no bounds but when we are pushed to the edge and tested, we end adharma once and for all – be it slaying Ravan in Treta Yug, demolishing Babur’s Babri structure in 1992 or bulldozing the mafia to the ground today.31 years on, every year on this day a certain ecosystem mourns the physical death of Babri structure while the civilisational wounds of a devout Hindu continue to be healed. On 22nd January 2024, Ram Lalla’s Pran Pratishtha will be performed and He will finally be resting comfortably watching over us from His Bhavya Mandir.On 6th December 2023, we must remember and celebrate the men and women across the nation who enabled this movement and reignited hope in Hindus. They taught us that bullets and barricades can’t kill our souls. We must dare to demolish injustice to the ground every time it pops its ugly face and pave the way for justice.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources. We need your support to fight them.

"5 December, 2023 ","BJP increases vote share in Telangana but fails to win even as anger brewed against KCR: How it got the chemistry wrong, not mathematics",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-increase-voteshare-telangana-fails-win-anger-kcr-result-analysis/,"The anger against KCR was real. So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023.At one of the pre-2019 meetings in Hyderabad, a BJP karyakarta stood up and asked the leader presiding that meeting – All these years, we have been dancing in front of the party office to celebrate victories in other states. When will we dance at our office to celebrate our victories in our state? The hall reverberated with claps, specifically at the tone and manner in which the question was posed – a tone steeped in anguish yet passionate to put everything at stake so that he could dance for the said reason. For many decades leading up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, this dance eluded the karyakarta. Hence the anguish. They saw real hope post-2014. Hence the excitement. The passion was always there. It was the direction that they were looking for. And the karyakartas got their first opportunity to dance when the BJP won an unprecedented 4 Lok Sabha seats for the first time in Telangana. The first step towards the ultimate dream of capturing power in Telangana was made. Bandi Sanjay Kumar was made President of the party. The second step was made. The party won the all-important Dubbaka bye-poll. Third step. The party stormed the GHMC polls in an unprecedented manner. Fourth step. The party President started his padayatra, right from Owaisi’s bastion. He stood right before Charminar and made thousands of karyakartas chant Bharat Mata ki Jai, Vande Mataram and Jai Shree Ram – something people thought was never possible. Yeah yeah – he got “communal” and all that. But you need to know about Owaisi’s bastion to understand the monumental scale of what the karyakarta felt when Bandi Sanjay did what he did, on the day he started his padayatra. Fifth step. A big leap.  KCR fired one of his best lieutenants – Eatata Rajendar. The BJP convinced him to join them. He did and won the all-important Huzurabad bye-election. The stride of the steps was just increasing. The BJP held its national executive in Hyderabad and then held a massive public meeting – the crowd was so huge that the Prime Minister was pleasantly surprised and patted Bandi Sanjay on his back for it. Small gesture, but gave much-needed fuel to continue the pace of the steps being taken for the ultimate goal – power in Telangana in 2023. A Congress MLA resigned and joined the BJP, thus prompting a bye-election. Rahul Gandhi’s famed BJ Yatra was passing through the state when this bye-election was happening. KCR sent 80 of its MLAs to this one constituency to defeat the BJP. Against such strong odds, the BJP still put up a great fight despite losing this seat. A setback but definitely not the end of the road. Mysteriously, very mysteriously, this setback became the end of the road for the BJP’s rise in the state!The karyakarta was flabbergasted when Bandi Sanjay’s term was not extended after his 3-year term ended in March 2023. Yes, missteps were made. The mighty BJP could have easily groomed Bandi Sanjay better when certain issues were being brought to the fore. It is still an abiding mystery why the central unit of the party could not find the right resources to groom a fledgling state unit. It’s not as if this is something new for a party like the BJP. They have tremendous experience and accessibility to resources to handle situations like this. The backlash from the karyakarta at removing Bandi Sanjay from the position wasn’t anticipated by the central unit. I find it very hard to believe though – for a party like the BJP that thrives on feedback, it is tough to believe that they didn’t anticipate this. For a party like the BJP that did what they did in MP and Chhattisgarh, it is indeed a mystery as to why they gave up on Telangana. Yes, we can list out all the missteps the party took in the run-up to the 2023 elections. We can talk about the mathematics of the election. In fact, I started this article to explain the mathematics behind BJP’s loss. Using the below graphic, I wanted to explain how the party that took GHMC by storm in 2020 has failed woefully in 2023 in the exact same area. I wanted to refer to the increase in overall vote percentage for the party; the victory in the northern areas of Telangana etc. And then I read this beautiful post written by a Twitter handle – Gems of KCR. This is when it dawned upon me that the BJP lost this election because it faltered on chemistry, not on the mathematics of the election. Who is the person behind GemsOfKCR?I'm a common man, hailing from a humble family background from rural Telangana, fought for my village's issues. In 2016 questioned BRS MLA in public and asked him to solve my village problem. He has promised to solve but he didn't.Instead of…The anger against KCR was real (we explained in multiple articles here on OpIndia why people are angry). So real that the voter did not mind choosing the Congress party over KCR when it was the BJP that was responsible for the increasing anti-incumbency. The chemistry that the party built in the 2019 to 2022 was mysteriously broken in 2023. This election is BJP’s loss more than the Congress’s victory (not to take away credit, but Congress’s rise only coincided with BJP’s downfall). The karyakarta who wanted to dance the ultimate step in 2023 will now have to wait till for 2028 for the next chance. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"6 December, 2023 ",Press release announcing Mahanth Balaknath Yogi as next CM of Rajasthan is fake: State BJP,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/press-release-announcing-mahanth-balaknath-yogi-as-cm-of-rajasthan-is-fake-state-bjp/,"The fake press release attributed to BJP claimed that the party had selected Mahanth Balaknath Yogi as the next Chief Minister with two Deputy CMsDays after the BJP achieved a resounding victory in Rajasthan, speculations have been rife over the appointment of the next Chief Minister of the state. Following these developments, on 6th December, a purported press release attributed to BJP claimed that the party had selected Mahanth Balaknath Yogi as the next Chief Minister and appointed two Deputy Chief Ministers to assist the CM.It also stated that Senior BJP leader and MLA from Sawai Madhopur Kirodi Lal Meena and MLA from Rajsamand Diya Kumari will be the two Deputy Chief Ministers. However, the Bhartiya Janata Party’s state unit took to X (formerly Twitter) and alerted that the press release claimed to be theirs is Fake. Fake Alert ! pic.twitter.com/GABYXWHveOFrom its official Twitter handle BJP4Rajasthan, the party tweeted, “Fake Alert!” along with the forged press release having the party’s name as the header to make it look authentic.Earlier on 3rd December, the BJP defeated the ruling party Congress after it secured 115 seats. While Congress bagged 69 seats, other parties in the likes of Bharat Adivasi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party secured 3 and 2 seats respectively. Since then, the race for the next Chief Minister of Rajasthan has thrown up many probable faces including the likes of Mahanth Balaknath, Diya Kumari, Former CM Vasundhara Raje, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat among others.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"22 November, 2023 ","No, Shakib Al Hasan wasn’t beaten up on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup: Here’s the truth about the viral video",https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/shakib-al-hasan-wasnt-beaten-up-on-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-world-cup-truth-about-the-viral-video/,"An old video of Bangladeshi cricketer Shakib Al-Hasan being beaten up and shoved around is going viral on social media with the claim that the all-rounder had been pushed around on his return to Bangladesh after the World Cup. In the wake of Bangladesh’s poor performance in the World Cup 2023, a video of Shakib Al Hasan being pulled, and thrashed by a mob is going viral on the internet. It is being claimed that the Bangladeshi Captain Shakib was mobbed by angry Bangladeshi fans on his return to the country. The viral video was also shared by some media portals claiming that the Bangladeshi skipper was ‘brutally beaten’/ ‘assaulted’ after the team’s World Cup debacle.  Kalesh b/w Bangladeshi Fans and Shakib al hasan, when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign  pic.twitter.com/C7DQK93gAkThis happened to Shakib when he returned to Bangladesh after poor World Cup campaign Bangladeshi people are top tier ret@rds https://t.co/iFDogEkZCA pic.twitter.com/xKkkyfmLFRJournalist Anil Tiwari who writes for Qatari mouthpiece Aljazeera, as per his Twitter bio, tweeted, “Bangladeshi fans assaulted their captain Shakib Al Hasan.

Utterly disgraceful behavior. #CricketWorldCup #Cricket #Bangladesh  pic.twitter.com/bYY9Cn6xBSHere are some headlines from media portals making those claims alongside sharing the viral video. A Cricket portal named OneCricket headlined (Archive) “[Watch] Shakib Al Hasan Gets ‘Brutally Beaten’ By Bangladesh Fans After Horrific World Cup Run”Notably, Bangladesh performed badly and finished in the eighth spot in the recently concluded World Cup, falling way below the fans’ expectations. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side only managed to win 2 games and the skipper himself had an unforgettable outing. He had to bench himself in some games due to injury concerns. However, the claims being made on the basis of the viral videos are fake. The video doing rounds on the internet is an old video. The said incident involving Shakib Al Hasan captured in the video took place in March this year, that is the video is 8 months old. It is not linked with Bangladesh’s poor performance at the World Cup or Shakib’s below-per-performance. Additionally, the Bangladeshi skipper was not assaulted or mobbed on his return to the country after the team’s World Cup debacle, as claimed on the internet.  The incident took place in Dubai on 16th March when Shakib Al Hasan went for a commercial event at a Jewelry store. After his series against England in March this year, Shakib flew to Dubai to inaugurate a gold jewelry shop that was owned by Arav Khan. Khan is a Bangladeshi fugitive and wanted in the murder case of a police official.At the time of the incident, Shakib was surrounded by fans who went out of control and he tried to rush out. However, in the chaos, he almost fell over while fans kept pulling his collar to stop him and take selfies with him. As seen from the video and confirmed by media reports of that time, he had no security around him to keep fans in check.   Regarding the Dubai incident involving Shakib, the Additional commissioner (detective) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) told the media that the man (Robiul Islam) who uploaded the video is from Bangladesh. The Police official added that Islam had murdered a police officer and had taken an Indian passport. He noted that the accused then went on to live in Dubai and despite knowing his criminal past Shakib went to his event. It is important to note here that Arav Khan’s original name is Robiul Islam. He hails from Kotalipara in Gopalganj and fled the country after charges of murder.The officer added that as part of the investigation, the Bangladeshi Cricket team’s captain might also be quizzed. Sharing reports and details of the original incident, several Twitter users called out the fake claims being made about Shakib Al Hasan. The users slammed individuals and media outlets for peddling these false claims, particularly those who connected the recent setback for Bangladesh with an older video depicting fans pulling his shirt, falsely portraying it as a case of him being manhandled or assaulted while attempting to take a selfie. This footage from Dubai in purposes of business and the audio was taken from a tv DramaOld news pic.twitter.com/NTb3uviioDFAKE NEWS BUSTED !! #ShakibAlHasanhttps://t.co/W7lwtlO2TaI hope you recover from the hated of your own bitrthland.Fake voice alertThis is a 8 months old video from dubai.where he went for promotion and fans wanted to take it photo with him.Crowd went out of control.Such a disgusting thing that it is morphed by a Bangladeshi Kohli fan pic.twitter.com/89qzTQvfsfSome users accused that the fake claims were peddled by Kohli fans in Bangladesh.

"18 November, 2023 ",Madhya Pradesh: Political fight between two groups in Jabalpur portrayed online as an attack on Sikhs,https://www.opindia.com/2023/11/madhya-pradesh-jabalpur-sikh-man-beaten-poltiical-fight-given-communal-angle-fact-check/,"The scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during the Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. On Friday (17th November), a video of a confrontation between two groups was falsely presented as a hate crime against the Sikh community by a Hindu mob.The incident reportedly took place in Jabalpur city of Madhya Pradesh. A Sikh man in a scooter was assaulted by a group of men, the video of which went viral on social media.Prominent fake news peddlers attempted to give a communal spin to the incident. “Sikh was attacked by a Hindu mob…Nobody is safe under BJP ruled government unless he is a BJP supporter,” claimed Islamist X handle ‘RheA’.Another Islamist claimed, “First Muslim, then Dalit and now Sikh.”“Madhya Pradesh – Sikh attacked by Hindu mob in Jabalpur. While raising religious slogans, people badly beat up a person from the Sikh community,” tweeted one ‘mdirfan997’.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) also amplified the incident and asked the Madhya Pradesh Police to take action.SGPC President Harjinder Singh Dhami has taken notice of a viral video from Jabalpur, in which, a Sikh is seen being assaulted by some men. He said that such an incident of assault with insult to Sikh turban and Kes (unshorn hair) is highly unfortunate and strongly condemnable.… https://t.co/HAVPR9P1D5Contrary to claims on social media, the scuffle took place between a politician (the Sikh man seen in the video) and members of the opposite political party during Vidhan Sabha polling in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. There was no ‘communal angle’ in the incident.Secretary of the Vidarbha Taxpayers Association (VTA), Tejinder Singh Renu, informed, “A video circulated widely on social media (screenshots shared) is from Jabalpur; but it has nothing to do with #Hindu #Sikh enmity.”“Yesterday there were elections in Madhya Pradesh and this incident happened in the Madan Mahal area.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Washington Post and its hit job on ‘Disinfo Lab’: Exposing the nefarious campaign to discredit Indian OSINT handle before 2024 Lok Sabha election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/,"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, The Washington Post has launched a campaign of sorts to de-legitimise those exposing anti-India narratives and promote individuals disseminating propaganda against India.On Sunday (10th December), the leftist media outlet carried out a hit job on the Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’ To this effect, it published an article titled ‘Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.’The development comes two days after American political commentator Jack Posobiec revealed how The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Priyanshu Verma had been soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab.’‘Disinfo Lab’ is the same OSINT handle, which earlier exposed how the US State Department was relying on misleading data (sourced from Christian evangelist groups and radical Islamist outfits) to allege a decline in India’s religious freedom.It was thus obvious that US-based leftist media outlets such as The Washington Post would make attempts to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’ sooner or later. Based on ‘sources’, Pranshu Verma and his two other colleagues claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Intelligence Officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.The trio at The Washington Post alleged that the objective of ‘Disinfo Lab’ is to ‘research and discredit foreign critics of the Modi government’, ‘combine fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims’, ‘intimidate individuals overseas’ and ‘run covert influence operation.’However, a cursory look at the website of the OSINT handle reveals that it is focused on uncovering disinformation campaigns, aimed at tarnishing the image of India on a global scale. Nevertheless, this did not stop The Washington Post from making sweeping claims about it. “The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” it brazened out.The leftist media outlet roped in several ‘experts’ to suggest that the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi is using an OSINT handle with 45.6K followers to undermine political rivals and create a global narrative.One such expert was an ‘academic’ named Joyjeet Pal. He claimed, “The Indian right wing is a new player that has arrived on the world stage and wants to shape global discussion…So far, much of it is done in the same way it’s done within India — through crude, blunt force. But it’s getting smarter.” The Washinton Post introduced Pal as a University of Michigan Professor ‘who studies disinformation in India.’ Interestingly, he is the same ‘expert’ whose obscure research was used by Indian leftist propaganda outlet The Wire to discredit calls for investigating the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Claim: Raksha Mantri @rajnathsingh admitted on @CNNnews18 that Chinese soldiers crossed Indian side of LACFact: The Minister was referring to differing perceptions of LAC & presence of Chinese troops It is being misinterpreted as if Chinese troops entered Indian side of LAC pic.twitter.com/Xews6Ba1bqAnother controversial expert cited by The Washington Post in its report was ‘journalist’ Ajai Shukla. He claimed, “(The defence establishment) exists to serve national and strategic interests, not political interests. But the BJP under Modi has seen critics as anti-Indian, the enemies of India itself.”Shukla has a history of peddling fake news (here and here) in the context of the India-China border dispute. He had also disseminated conspiracy theories post the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and was dubbed sexist by a prominent Italian journalist. Despite such dwindling credibility, The Washington Post roped him as an expert for its propaganda-laden piece on ‘Disinfo Lab.’India has been under tremendous pressure to choose sides, following the Russia-Ukraine war. The US state apparatus and the media on several occasions had even threatened India with sanctions for purchasing oil from Russia, only to receive befitting replies from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Nevertheless, The Washington Post saw it as an opportunity to attack India’s neutral position in the ongoing crisis. “Coordinated social media accounts have been found to play a role, for instance, in spreading identical posts in support of Russia, an important supplier of weapons and energy to India…” it furthered the US State narrative.The leftist news outlet targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.Throughout its article, The Washington Post desperately tried to whitewash both anti-Hindu and anti-India activists and paint them as ‘victims’ of the social media exposé by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ One such activist mentioned by the leftist media outlet happens to be Pieter Friedrich, who has ties to Khalistani terrorist Bhajan Bhinder.“The organization released a dossier nearly 100 pages long alleging that Pieter Friedrich, a California-based activist and journalist who has written magazine articles and given public speeches critical of the BJP and affiliated Hindu-nationalist groups, had ties to the Sikh separatist movement and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. The Disinfo Lab burrowed into California state records to uncover Friedrich’s employment history, published his parents’ names and plotted detailed graphs about his social media activity,” it claimed.1) The days of people like Friedrich making threats against non-white people,especially because of the color of their skin, their religious affiliation, or their country of origin must remain behind us.In 2021, OpIndia reported how Pieter Friedrich evolved from a Christian zealot and a Gandhi basher to a ‘critic of Hindu fascism’ and a Khalistani asset. In June last year, he was slammed for allegedly giving death threats to a Hindu US Representative from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi.The Washington Post lamented that ‘Disinfo Lab’, which posted a plethora of evidence tying ‘activist’ Sunita Vishwanath to far-left billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), was used against Congress scion Rahul Gandhi.“The Disinfo Lab dug into her past and reported that a nonprofit she launched to help female Afghan refugees had received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Two months later, after Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting in Washington with Viswanath as part of a U.S. tour, Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted a photo of the meeting and shared a flowchart stamped with the Disinfo Lab logo illustrating Viswanath’s connections to Soros,” wrote the leftist media outlet.Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by OSF. She is also the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr)’ and has tried to create hysteria and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We are especially appalled by the most recent nightmare of the Kashmiri people, and the situation of 1.9 million people in India who are rendered stateless due to the imposition of the travesty called the National Register of Citizens”, Vishwanath said in 2019. In September 2021, she also participated in the Hinduphobic conference ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva.’ The Washington Post also roped in the policy director of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr), Ria Chakraborty, to make a case for an organisation named ‘Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC).’➡️IAMC's terror angleIAMC has close ties with terror organizations like SIMI, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami.Infact, Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of SIMI, was once hosted as a guest at IAMC.Research credit – @DisinfoLab pic.twitter.com/iufbOJy9gsAccording to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Indian Americal Muslim Council has links [pdf] with the banned Islamic terror outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).Besides, the Indian American Muslim Council has ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) through its founder Shaik Ubaid. The IAMC is a Jamat-e-Islami-backed lobbyist organisation claiming to be a rights advocacy group.It had been caught spreading fake news to further the Islamist cause in India. It had also been slapped with the UAPA in 2021.The Washington Post also made references to anti-Brahmin activist Thenmozhi Soundarajan and her organisation ‘Equality Labs’. Soundarajan had shot to fame in 2018 after the then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clicked pictures with a poster, designed by her, carrying the tagline ‘Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy.’In April 2022, tech giant Google cancelled a talk by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, owing to the fear that it might create ‘division and rancour’ in the workplace. Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry had said, “We also made the decision to not move forward with the proposed talk which — rather than bringing our community together and raising awareness — was creating division and rancour.”In November last year, she went on an unhinged tirade against Yoga. During the one-and-a-half-hour-long podcast, Soundararajan cast aspersions on the history of the ancient Indian Hindu practice and claimed that it was used by Brahmins to oppress the Dalit community. She also insinuated that Yoga had an in-built system of hierarchy, which supposedly made it vulnerable to abuse.What does it mean to address the structural violence at the heart of yoga? I break the silence on the religious abuse that is at the heart of yoga and how healing begins with debrahminizing and decolonizing. Check it on the latest #conspirituality pod https://t.co/7OadWRA1EP pic.twitter.com/gWgEWCwIv7The Washington Post also attempted to whitewash far-left billionaire George Soros and his nefarious anti-India agenda.The leftist media outlet wrote, “In February, Soros, a frequent critic of Modi, warned in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that the Indian leader was undemocratic and would lose his “stranglehold” over the Indian government. A day later, the Disinfo Lab posted a lengthy tweet thread alleging that Soros had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and manipulated “fake” U.S.-based advocacy groups to smear India. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundations called the Disinfo Lab’s claims “entirely baseless” and said they were part of a “campaign by this site and others in India against advocates of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law in the service of the political aims of the BJP and its allies.”“India has been fighting a ‘perception war’ on all fronts since the start of 2023. On February 16 this year, George Soros exploited the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and launched a scathing attack on the Indian government.He claimed, “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined…Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”Soros accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he added.The Hungarian-American billionaire also said that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time.The Hungarian-American billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including Freedom House and  V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute to tarnish the image of India at a global level.In January 2020, the American billionaire committed $1 billion to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation.Throughout the article, The Washington Post resorted to insinuations, and source-based allegations to discredit ‘Disinfo Lab.’ However, it failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of the Indian OSINT handle.The leftist news outlet had not refuted the assertion by ‘Disinfo lab’ that its exposé had led to the shutting down of several sources of fake data. “In its response to The Post, the Disinfo Lab pointed to its record of forcing “activists” and “human rights fronts” to shut down by exposing them,” it noted.Ironically, one such source of fake data, DOTO (Data of Database of the Oppressed), was cited by WaPo tech ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma in an article in January 2023 to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India.Turned out DOTO was full of fabrication & outright imagination. We exposed their fabrication, after which they first tried revising their data and later deleted and disappeared.DOTO met its fate in October this year and is no more among us. (RIP!)(12/n) pic.twitter.com/y55TrdzNWS‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. The OSINT handle also uncovered the lies of another dubious organisation called OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India), following which the latter shut shop permanently.But after our exposé they shut down OFMI, pulled down its website, deleted traces, and went into oblivion. Most of the activists associated with them have also removed all references to OFMI.(6/n) pic.twitter.com/uj0DRlnTkhThe leftist media outlet had reached out to prominent people in the hopes of deterring them from sharing informative posts by ‘Disinfo Lab’. The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma messaged American political commentator Jack Posobiec on Friday (8th December) and claimed that the Indian OSINT handle is run by an Intelligence officer.“We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab. Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he claimed. Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0He further added, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?“Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.After the article was published, The Washington Post did not reproduce the actual response of Jack Posobiec. While resorting to shrewd dishonesty, it wrote,” Posobiec did not address whether he was familiar with the organisation’s background.“With the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind, The Washington Post is leaving no stone unturned to make insinuations about the Modi government and target individuals and accounts known for debunking anti-India propaganda.The development comes amidst growing concerns about ‘regime change’ operations in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Just last month, The Washington Post published a misleading piece wherein it dubbed requests for action to X (formerly Twitter) against extemists by Indian government as ‘global standard for online censorship.’Earlier, it romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in Kashi.The Washington Post has also published a dubious report on India and its solar power systems. It has given editorial space to the likes of scam-accused ‘journalist’ Rana Ayyub to parrot the narrative of ‘Muslims are in danger in India.’None of these articles are random but serve a sinister agenda to create a narrative that paints the incumbent elected government as ‘anti-democracy’ and ‘anti-minority’.In the US, The Washington Post has attempted to distort public perceptions through its dissemination of the Russian disinformation hoax – A conspiracy theory that suggests that the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential election was influenced by Russia.It had also suppressed the ‘Hunter Biden Laptop’ story and influenced the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election. With less than 6 months left for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Indian public must be wary of attempts by Western publications to peddle their sinister agendaWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The dignity of the parliament house was breached on the night of 21st September when Ramesh Bidhuri abused me. Soul of Gandhi and Ambedkar must be weeping today.TMC’s Krishnanagar MP Mahua Moitra has been expelled from the Lok Sabha after the Ethics Committee tabled its report on her corruption and bribery. She was expelled after the tabled report was debated and a vote was sought from MPs. Soon after Mahua Moitra’s expulsion, the left-liberal ecosystem in politics and media started reacting with tears and rants. From BSP MP Danish Ali saying Gandhi must be weeping to so-called neutral journalists getting goosebumps, every reaction from this clout represented the meltdown they had after the action against the now-former TMC MP.Bahujan Samaj Party MP Danish Ali said, “What is this?

All principles of natural justice were clouted. BJP by animal majority voted a member out just because she spoke about industrialist Adani and his relations with Prime Minister Modi.”TMC MP Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, “They tried to suppress the voice of opposition. Would not you listen to the one who is accused of so many severe allegations? This never happens. Parties of the I.N.D.I. alliance came together against this decision. It is a huge day for us.”Following the expulsion, Mahua Moitra, known for her tedious and boorish monologues in the parliament, launched another noisy rant outside the Parliament as an ex-MP. Speaking to the media with Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi standing behind her, Mahua Moitra screamed that there was no evidence of any cash or any gifts being taken by her. She even brazened out sharing her login credentials with Darshan Hiranandani, stating that there is no rule specified against sharing login credentials. She then shouted that an MP sharing her credentials with a businessman so that he could pose questions targeted at his rival business entity is not wrong, because MPs are there to raise questions on behalf of the public anyway. Resharing the video of her rant on X, Arfa Khanum Sherwani quoted her sentences and said that she got goosebumps to see Mahua Moitra speak like that. Sherwani posted, “I am 49 years old. I will fight you for the next 30 years. Inside the parliament, and outside on the streets. We are going to come back and we are going to see the end of you. Goosebumps!”I am 49 years old.

Shameful.”Without due process and being given a chance to defend herself #MahuaMoitra is expelled. ShamefulNotably, Mahua Moitra was given a fair opportunity to present her side in front of the ethics committee of the parliament. However, the left-liberal ecosystem kept spreading the lie that she was denied a chance to defend herself. This is because Mahua Moitra reportedly requested to speak on behalf of her party during the discussion after the report of the committee was tabled in the house, but she was denied.India Today journalist Rajdeep Sardesai posted from his X handle, “So a 104-page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled. An hour later, the TMC MP is formally expelled by voice vote without being given a chance to speak or any of the MPs having even a chance to read the report in any detail and respond. No cross-examination of key witness Darshan Hiranandani. Natural justice anyone? When the issue is as serious as the expulsion of an MP, surely there is a need for a fair hearing and due process, no? Think.”So a 104 page ethics committee report is tabled in Mahua Moitra case at 12 noon; at 2 pm, a ‘debate’ is scheduled within two hours of the report being tabled.

Hiranandani has admitted to paying cash, lavish gifts to Moitra, and having access to her Lok Sabha login credentials.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing.

It was enlarged in 2021 to about 5 lakh square feet. This has allowed a capacity of 50,000 - 75,000 devotees in the temple premises.The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi has become one of the top pilgrimage spots in India as a record 12.92 crore devotees visited the holy shrine in two years. Notably, the expanded Kashi Vishwanath Dham will soon complete its two years on 13th December. Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Kashi Vishwanath Dham corridor on 13th December 2021, and since then, the number of devotees of Mahadev has increased manifold. The official added that the number is soon expected to breach the 13 crore mark. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the temple trust, Sunil Kumar Verma said, “Shri Kashi Vishwanath Dham was inaugurated on 13 December 2021. From then till 6 December 2023, more than 12 crore, 92 lakh and 24 thousand devotees have taken darshan of Baba. By the end of December, this number is expected to cross 13 crore.”During the auspicious month of Shrawan and other special occasions and festivals, a huge influx of devotees throng the temple premises. As per the official data, during the months of Shrawan alone, more than 1.6 crore devotees visited the temple. This year, because of Adhik maas, the Sawan month was 59 days long. In July, the temple saw a footfall of over 72 lakh devotees and the number increased to 95.6 lakh in August.

"8 December, 2023 ",High priest to lead the consecration ceremony of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya is a descendant of priest who presided over the coronation of Chhatrapati...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/know-the-shivaji-connection-of-priest-who-will-lead-ram-temple-consecration/,"More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. 86-year-old Vedic scholar Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit is expected to preside over the consecration ritual of the Ram Lalla idol at the Ram temple in Ayodhya on 22 January, marking a landmark confluence of heritage and modern relevance. He is a Varanasi native and reportedly descended from the distinguished Kashi scholar Gaga Bhatt of the 17th century who headed the coronation of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj around 350 years ago in 1674, which was a momentous occasion in Indian history that represented the creation of Hindavi Swarajya, an autonomous Maratha state.More than 40 scholars from Kashi and 121 from all branches of the Vedas throughout India are scheduled to be guided by him during the solemn idol consecration ceremonies from January 16 to January 22. The learned man responded, “It is because of the blessings bestowed on me by the legendary saints and seers of Kashi that I have been assigned the responsibility of supervising the consecration of Ram Lalla. I will perform my duties with the blessings of Lord Ram,” in an interview.The scholar’s son, Sunil Laxmikant Dixit stated that his father’s areas of expertise included yajna, consecration, Srauta which is a Sanskrit word rooted in Sruti or that which is heard and Smarta which is based on Smriti, a particular collection of Hindu literature among other rites and rituals. “My father’s study of the Vedas and rituals was under the supervision of his uncle Ganesh Dixit Javji Bhatt. He completed his studies in Shukla Yajurveda at Sangved Vidyalaya and took up teaching in the same institution. Mathuranath Dixit proclaimed, “Our roots are in Jeur village near Solapur in Maharashtra. Our ancestors moved to Kashi and dedicated their lives to the study of Hindu traditions and rituals.” Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and other priests are conducting a series of religious ceremonies as part of the meticulous preparation of the consecration procedures which are scheduled to begin on 16 January. These customs which culminate on 22 January when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to carry out the rites commemorating the consecration of the Ram Lalla idol include Sarva Prayashchit homam, Dashvid Snan, Jalyatra, Tirth and Kalash Pujan as well as Kalash Yatra.Three idols of Ram Lalla are being made in Ayodhya, and the religious committee of the temple trust is tasked with picking the finest among them. The idols of Lord Ram are believed to be almost finished and are 90% concluded. The idols depict the diety’s child form. One idol is made with stone from Rajasthan and two are made from stones brought from Karnataka, the finishing touches will require around a week. Earlier, a stone was brought from Nepal, and later stones were also brought from Odisha and Maharashtra to carve the idol, but those were found not suitable. The sanctum sanctorum and the temple’s ground floor are already in a highly developed state of preparedness. Among the several ceremonies leading up to the consecration, one of the main ones on 21 January is the immersion of the idol of Ram Lalla in water from sacred rivers and well-known Hindu pilgrimage destinations which is collected in 114 urns. On 22 January in the afternoon, there will be Devpranpratishtha (consecration) rites. The idol will be brought from 8 a.m. to noon to the sanctum sanctorum. Pran-Pratishtha of Ram Lalla will be observed on 16 January and the principal rituals will be performed on 22 January by Lakshmikant Dixit.After visiting the Vice President of Vishva Hindu Parishad Champat Rai in September, the Kanchi Kamakoti Shankaracharya despatched a team of scholars, including Laxmikant Mathuranath Dixit and Acharya Ganesh Shastri Dravid to Ayodhya to determine the dates of consecration.Notable individuals who have been invited to the consecration ceremony of the Ram temple include actors Arun Govil and Dipika Chikhlia who played Lord Ram and Goddess Sita in the hit TV series ‘Ramayana,’ industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani and Ratan Tata, cricketers Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan among other actors.Over 7,000 guests comprising 3,000 VIPs have received invites from the Ram Mandir Trust. There will also be an invitation sent to the families of the karsevaks who lost their lives in the temple movement. Further invitees consist of 4,000 seers, writers, journalists, scientists, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) president Mohan Bhagwat, yoga guru Ramdev and esteemed figures from all around the nation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ","Mohit Pandey to be the chief priest of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: While the leftist ecosystem is linking it with caste, here is why...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohit-pandey-caste-ram-mandir-leftist-ecosystem/,"Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. The process of selecting priests to perform prayers at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was recently completed. As part of the process, regular applications were invited from interested devotees, and around 3000 people participated. The interested parties had to undergo a rigorous selection process that included specific criteria for choosing the priests for the Ram Mandir. In this entire process, 200 applicants were interviewed, out of which 50 candidates were selected for the post of priests.Subsequently, the reports saying that Mohit Pandey had been selected as the chief priest went viral on social media. Reacting to these reports, certain social media users tried to cast aspersions and raise questions over the selection process for priests asking why only a Brahmin was selected for this post.Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. A Dalit portal named ‘The Mooknayak’ tweeted in Hindi, ” Mohit Pandey will become the priest of Ram temple! Is it forbidden for Dalits to become priests?” ""राम मंदिर के पुजारी बनेंगे मोहित पांडे!""– क्या दलितों का पुजारी बनना मना है? pic.twitter.com/aZRstoJcA0Dilip Mandal fumed and wrote, “This temple is being built by the Government of India as a trust. It is not anyone’s ancestral property. There should be an agitation if the reservation is not given in the temple management. Everyone will give Dakshina and only one caste will withdraw all the money, this will not work.” बहुत सही। वैसे भी ये मंदिर भारत सरकार का ट्रस्ट बना रहा है। किसी के बाप की संपत्ति नहीं है। मंदिर मैनेजमेंट में रिज़र्वेशन न दिया गया तो आंदोलन होना चाहिए। दक्षिणा सब देंगे और सिर्फ सारा पैसा एक जाति के लोग निकालेंगे, ये नहीं चलेगा। https://t.co/Rp2qUwV6BeAn X user named Suraj Yadav in a sarcastic tone claimed that Dalits, OBCs, and Tribals are not Hindus. He wrote, “If he is a Hindu then he is selected. Keep in mind that Dalits, backward people, and tribals are not Hindus. Shudras, Ati Shudras, and people outside the caste system have no place either in the trust or in the place of worship. And this is especially for those Yadavs who are supporters of Manuvad or Brahminism.”हिन्दू है तो चयनित हुआ। दलित, पिछड़े, आदिवासी हिन्दू नहीं हैं, यह ध्यान रहे। शूद्र, अति शूद्र, जाति प्रथा से बाहर लोगों को न तो ट्रस्ट में स्थान है और न ही पूजा स्थल में। और यह उन यादवों के लिए ख़ास तौर से जो मनुवाद या ब्राह्मणवाद के समर्थक हैं। #SC_ST_OBC #ईवीएम_हटाओ… pic.twitter.com/RadVOwhiK9However, the pertinent thing is that those who are casting aspersions, neither know about the selection process nor are they aware of the merit due to which Mohit Pandey was selected for the post of Chief Priest.For those unversed, the necessary condition to become a priest in the Ramlala temple was that the candidate should have studied Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit from a recognised Gurukul. Additionally, the candidate must have been initiated into the Ramanandiya tradition. In line with that, attention was paid to the knowledge of Vedas, rituals, and Vedic mantras during the interview process to select priests for the Ram Mandir. The upper limit for the candidates was fixed at 30 years.Furthermore, despite their selection as Priest and Chief Priest, the selected candidates will have to undergo a long training period, which would last for 6 months, before they start performing their duties. In this training phase, they will be imparted in-depth knowledge of Vedas, rituals, Vedic mantras, and Ramayana. Only after the training phase is over, the priests will be able to perform the worship of Ramlala.As per the selection criteria, it was necessary to be a scholar of the Ramnandiya tradition, as well as to have expertise in the knowledge of Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit. The fact that Mohit Pandey passed all the selection criteria based on merit and ability, just like other candidates who were also evaluated, means that allegations of casteism and religious favoritism don’t arise. Notably, Mohit Pandey studied for seven years at Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth, Ghaziabad. He obtained a Shastri (Bachelor) degree from Sri Venkateswara Vedic University, affiliated with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in Tirupati. In 2023, he earned a master’s degree in Samaveda. He is also a scholar of the Ramanandiya tradition and possesses expertise in Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Likewise, other selected priests include youth from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. All the selected priests belong to the Ramanandiya tradition and have expertise in the Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Speaking with The New Indian Express, Professor Rani Sadashiva Murthy, Vice-Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara Vedic University expressed happiness over the selection of Mohit Pandey to the post of Chief Priest of Shri Ram Lal Temple. Murthy said, “Many students from the University serve as priests and acharyas in various temples. A soft-spoken person, Pandey’s nature, focus and dedication to his studies have earned him the opportunity to serve Lord Ram in the esteemed Ayodhya Ram mandir.”Mohit Pandey’s journey, from Ghaziabad to Tirupati and now Ayodhya after being selected as the Chief Priest of Ram Lala, is a testament to his dedication and rigorous training. Institutions like Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth and Sri Venkateswara Vedic University in Ghaziabad have played a crucial role in nurturing individuals with spiritual abilities, as evidenced by their selection process.In such a situation, those who are pointing fingers at his selection and linking it with castism are vitiating society by fanning the caste divide. While the ecosystem has been carrying out smear campaigns and cast aspersions, it is important to highlight that there are several temples in different states of India, there are not only Dalit or Women priests, prayers are performed by Dalit women priests in these temples.In a previous article, OpIndia highlighted temples in which women and Dalits have been performing the responsibility of priests.

"10 December, 2023 ","Old video of Bengali singer, highlighting selective outrage of Muslims, goes viral: Read details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/old-clipped-viral-video-muslim-hypocrisy-poem-hindus-in-bangladesh/,"While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards.A week ago, a video of a woman highlighting the silence of Bangladeshi Muslims over the atrocities committed against Hindus in the Islamic Republic went viral on X (formerly Twitter).A user named ‘SK Chakraborty(@sanjoychakra)’ posted the video on the micro-blogging platform on 3rd December, which had since garnered 1.79 lakh views. The video was shared over 1800 times and was liked by 3500 users.‘Sk Chakraborty’ informed that he did not know about the identity of the woman, who had conveyed the pain of the Hindu community and the hypocrisy of militant Muslims in the form of a melodious poem. This gutsy H woman in her melodius voice sings about Hindu oppression bringing out the pain of Hindus and hypocricy of M. Militant M.. are inciting communal riots across Facebook. She shouldn’t face the fate of Kanhaiyalal.Rough translation- “Free loader, son of M. Your tears… pic.twitter.com/Rwdr2iF8eXWith the help of our sources, OpIndia was able to ascertain the identity of the woman as Indian Bengali singer Mousumi Hossain. She is a native of Barasat, located in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. At the time of writing, Mousumi had 7.1K followers on Facebook. After closely listening to the lyrics in the video, OpIndia was able to find a transcript of the poem that was uploaded on the website ‘Kobita Cocktail in 2019. The name of the poet was mentioned as Akhtaruzzaman Azad.We found that Azad is a Dhaka-based author and has more than 1.12 lakh followers on Facebook. It became clear that he indeed wrote the poem in the context of Bangladesh, although Indian singer Mousumi Hossain featured in the viral video. On further digging into the matter, OpIndia was able to trace the video on the timeline of Akhtaruzzaman Azad. The video was posted on 29th June last year.In the caption, the poet informed that the name of the poem is ‘Awoj Abar Tolo’ which loosely translates to ‘Raise Your Voice now.’ The poem deals with the subject of religious extremism and selective outrage by various religious denominations (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists). Each stanza, barring the last and penultimate, is dedicated to the antics of followers of each Faith.The poet Akhtaruzzaman Azad calls upon society to shed religious differences, stop the bloodshed and see the goodness in one another. The poem has been recited like a song by singer Mousumi Hossain. It must be mentioned that only the first stanza of the poem (and not the entirety of it), concerning the hypocrisy of Muslims living in Bangladesh, has been going viral on social media.In that particular stanza, the poet highlights how believers in Allah (Mumin) are willing to cry their hearts out on learning about murders in Palestine or the plight of Rohingyas in Myanmar. He emphasises how Muslims are ever-ready to wail about ‘saving Gaza’ but have no tears to shed for Hindus dying in Bangladesh. The poem brings out the distinction in this selective ‘concern for humanity.’ –In the first stanza, the poet highlights how the Muslim community screams over the death of someone named ‘Malik or Khalik ‘ but does not even whisper for a deceased named ‘Naresh or Paresh’.While concluding the first stanza, Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions how the Muslim community in Bangladesh can live with such glaring double-standards. He talks about the behavioural patterns of followers of other Faiths such as Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism in the second, third and fourth stanzas.In the end, he the poet makes an appeal for peace among different factions of the society.Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the 1-year-old video is going viral on social media. Given that the poem by Akhtaruzzaman Azad questions the selective silence of the Muslim community in Bangladesh (in the first stanza), which perfectly fits a pattern in the Islamic world, it is gaining traction among netizens. বাংলাদেশে বিবেক এখনো বেঁচে আছে। আমার প্রণাম নিন। আখতারুজ্জামান আজাদের কবিতা–""এই যে তুমি মস্ত মুমিন, মুসলমানের ছেলে;বক্ষ ভাসাও, ফিলিস্তিনে খুনের খবর পেলে।রোহিঙ্গাদের দুঃখে তুমি এমন কাঁদা কাঁদো;ভাসাও পুরো আকাশ-পাতাল, ভাসাও তুমি চাঁদও!অশ্রু তোমার তৈরি থাকে— স্বচ্ছ এবং তাজা;Ex-Governor of Meghalaya, Tathagatha Roy, shared the poem on X (formerly Twitter) on 1st November, 2023.The video is equally popular on Facebook amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Where is the money – What happens to the cash recovered by Enforcement Directorate or Income Tax department during raids,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/what-happens-to-cash-recovered-during-ed-raids-cbi-income-tax/,"First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and Income Tax (IT) Department conduct multiple raids every year, resulting in the recovery of unaccounted cash worth crores. With swanky photographs of seized money arranged to form letters like “E” and “D” to denote ED during raids, the question arises: What happens to the cash recovered by the agencies during raids?When the ED, CBI, or IT Department seizes unaccounted money, they cannot just keep it on their office premises. First of all, the accused gets a chance to explain where the cash came from. If the accused fails to give a satisfactory answer, the money is considered ill-gotten and seized under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) provisions.The actual process of seizing the cash starts from here. The State Bank of India is called in to count the seized cash. Simultaneously, a list of seized cash is prepared with the details of the recovered amount in specific denominations such as Rs 500, Rs 200, Rs 100, Rs 50 and so on. Based on the amount, the bank deploys multiple cash counting machines to ensure smooth and quick completion of the counting process.Once the counting is complete, the cash is sealed in the boxes in the presence of independent witnesses. The cash is then taken to the SBI branch, where it is deposited under the agency’s Personal Deposit (PD) account. Later, the cash is moved to the central government’s treasury.Notably, cash can be used only once the case is over in the court of law. Neither the ED, nor the bank, nor the government has the right to use the money for any purposes while the case is sub-judice. The agency issues a provisional attachment order, and an adjudicating authority must confirm the attachment within six months. This order ensures that the accused cannot benefit from the seized cash. Notably, the agency can only hold onto the cash for 180 days. During that time, the agency has to prove the validity of the seizure. In case the agency fails to do so, the money gets returned to the accused automatically.How the money will be used depends on the outcome of the case. If the accused acquits, the cash gets returned; otherwise, if convicted, the money becomes government property.Enforcement Directorate, Central Bureau of Investigation, and Income Tax Department can raid, investigate and seize property in cases of money laundering, scams, tax fraud, or irregularities.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"10 December, 2023 ",Who is Dhiraj Prasad Sahu – The Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand at the centre of the historic Income Tax raid,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dhiraj-prasad-sahu-rajya-sabha-mp-jharkhand-it-raid/,"Dhiraj Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, the Indian National Congress, the grand old party, is once again surrounded by controversies. The party has yet to recover from the crushing defeat in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections. It is now facing intense scrutiny as the Income Tax (IT) Department has recovered hundreds of crores of unaccounted cash from properties linked to its Jharkhand Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu.By 9th December, the IT Department recovered nearly Rs 300 crores from the premises linked to Sahu, and further recovery is still underway. Congress Party officially distanced itself from the controversy and claimed it had nothing to do with the cash recovered by the IT Department. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the Congress party’s General Secretary in Communications, Jairam Ramesh, claimed that the Indian National Congress has nothing to do with the businesses run by its Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand. The senior Congress functionary added that only the accused in the case, Sahu, could explain the source for vast piles of cash reportedly seized from his properties and demanded an explanation from Sahu.The money recovered by the IT department is said to be linked to Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Private Limited and its related organisations, where Sahu is a partner. Over nineteen bags containing cash were taken from the home of a certain Bunty Sahu, who was assigned to oversee the management of liquor facilities in the Odisha regions. Three dozen machines were deployed to count the cash. Reports suggest some of the machines broke down during counting, resulting in a delay in completing the process. Reportedly, Bhagat Beherea, the Regional Manager of the State Bank of India in Bolangir, said that the bank had received 176 bags containing money in total. Fifty workers and twenty-five counting machines have been deployed to count the currency notes.Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner in Baldev Sahu Infra Pvt Ltd, a group company of Budha Distilleries. He has been a Rajya Sabha MP from Jharkhand since 2009. Sahu’s family has been linked to Congress for a long time.Sahu started his political career in 1977 as a National Students Union of India (NSUI) member. Slowly and steadily, he climbed the party ladder and served as office-bearer in the Lohardaga district and later in the Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee.In 2009, he was elected Rajya Sabha member for the first time in a bypoll. He was re-elected for the second term in 2010. In May 2018, he became the third time Rajya Sabha member of Congress from Jharkhand.According to his profile on the Rajya Sabha website, his family has been associated with Congress since independence. He was part of “Jail Bharo Aandolan” in 1978. He has asked 630 questions in Rajya Sabha since 2010, with the latest being related to the Kavach Safety System, procurement of paddy, losses due to damage to national highways, accidents in coal mines, privatisation of airports and more.In November 2022, Sahu participated in Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, yet another attempt of the Congress Party to “launch” Gandhi into politics and project him as Prime Minister candidate for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. In a post on X, Dhiraj Sahu shared some photographs from the Yatra.भारत जोड़ो यात्रा के दौरान कुछ पल।#BharatJodoYatra@bharatjodo @INCIndia @INCJharkhand pic.twitter.com/g3lYQSRoBkLater, in February 2023, Sahu published a video from the Yatra and wrote, “Historic Bharat Jodo Yatra ended up winning the hearts of Indians.

Whatever has been looted from the public, every penny will have to be returned, this is Modi’s guarantee.” देशवासी इन नोटों के ढेर को देखें और फिर इनके नेताओं के ईमानदारी के 'भाषणों' को सुनें… 😂😂😂जनता से जो लूटा है, उसकी पाई-पाई लौटानी पड़ेगी, यह मोदी की गारंटी है। ❌❌❌💵 💵 💵❌❌❌ pic.twitter.com/O2pEA4QTOjSpeaking to Times Now, BJP leader Nishikant Dubey said, “The Congress leader is a partner in the two companies that are being raided. I feel the Income Tax department should transfer the case to the Enforcement Directorate considering the magnanimity of the situation.” In a post on X, he wrote, “The Rajya Sabha MP of Congress, Dhiraj Sahu, is declared as a partner in two companies, Baldev Sahu & Company and Shiv Prasad Sahu & Sons, whose shares have been accounted for at Rs 350 crores till now. The disclosure of 20 per cent of these shares is pending, and it is suspected to be undisclosed or benami, which will be revealed through an investigation. A raid at his residences in Ranchi and Lohardaga resulted in the recovery of Rs 20 crore in cash and assets, including gold, silver, and diamonds worth Rs 150 crore.

Moreover, the target has also been set to restore Bihar’s development by the year 2047, where there would be no migration, no lack of education or employment, however, such movements are the lifeblood of a dynamic Indian and it is important that they continue to be spread,” Bhadauria tweeted.आईपीएस विकास वैभव ने Let's Inspire Bihar नाम का अभियान शुरू किया है, इस अभियान की एक बड़ी रैली बेगूसराय में हुई, इस भीड़ ने इसलिए ध्यान खींचा क्यों कि ये राजनीतिक या धार्मिक कार्यक्रम नहीं था, इस अभियान से जुड़े हज़ारों सदस्य अब तक देश-विदेशों में कई कार्यक्रमों कर चुके हैं, आज… pic.twitter.com/sr184PpVtCThe unique aspect of this event is that this massive assembly of thousands of people was organized without the support of any political power. Nor was there going to be any benefit to the people, yet such a huge gathering took place only with the intention to restore and bring back the development of Bihar. The attendees even pledged saying, “I will transform Bihar and honor the land of my ancestors. We’re embracing resolutions.” मैं बदलूंगा बिहार ! मैं करूंगा अपने पूर्वजों की भूमि का पुनरुद्धार ! #नमस्ते_बिहार 🙏 pic.twitter.com/cbQfHOJ2wQ‘Let’s Inspire Bihar’ is an NGO, which runs social awareness and public awareness campaigns.

He is campaigning nonstop to bring about this transformation.Vikas Vaibhav, posted in Bihar as an IPS officer, has never said publicly about his involvement in politics, but he always says that the right people have to come into politics. If honest people come into politics, change in society will also arrive rapidly.According to IPS Vikas Vaibhav, decent, altruistic, and truthful people ought to enter politics. In the meantime, speculation about his desire to go into politics has begun. However, Vikas Vaibhav stated in a media interview that he is currently occupied with rebuilding Bihar through his NGO. “I am busy making people aware. Instead of being with my family every Saturday and Sunday, I try to be with the entire Bihar, so that I can bring social change in Bihar,” he said.

"12 December, 2023 ",First-time MLA and four-time state General Secretary Bhajan Lal Sharma: BJP signals organisational importance in choosing new CM for Rajasthan,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-rajasthan-general-secretary-bhajan-lal-sharma-cm/,"He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), contrary to the media speculations, announced Bhajan Lal Sharma as the CM-designate of Rajasthan. Further, his appointment is seen as a major deviation from the general political trend. Usually, seniority and political growth had been adjudged by the number of times a leader has been elected to the state assembly or Lok Sabha. 56-year-old Bhajan Lal Sharma is a first-time MLA. He completed his MA (politics) from Rajasthan University, Jaipur, in 1993.He is the elected MLA from Sanganer Assembly constituency. In the recently concluded 2023 Rajasthan assembly elections, he defeated Pushpendra Bhardwaj of Congress by 48,081 votes. The BJP had fielded him after denying a ticket to the sitting MLA Ashok Lahoti. However, Sharma, a resident of Bharatpur, is said to have a strong hold on organisational politics. Before plunging into electoral politics, he had been working in the organisation for a long time. Bhajan Lal Sharma has been playing an important part in BJP’s organisational structure in Rajasthan. He has served as the state general secretary for the Bharatiya Janata Party four times. Previously, he had been associated with RSS and ABVP. For this reason, he is considered close to the party’s ideological mentor RSS, and party chief JP Nadda.The three major announcements on three consecutive days have signalled that the organisational importance played a major role in these major selections. A key similarity in these decisions has been the history of these leaders in serving various organisational roles and strengthening the party’s cadre in these states. Apart from Sharma, Dr. Mohan Yadav, the new CM-designate of Madhya Pradesh had held several organisational posts in BJP and its ideological mentor RSS. Yadav, who started student politics at Madhav Science College, and held many positions in the party. In 1982, he was the co-secretary of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union and in 1984, he was the President of the Madhava Vigyan Mahavidyalaya Students’ Union.Mohan Yadav assumed the responsibility of Municipal Minister of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Ujjain) in the year 1984 and Department Head in 1986. In the year 1988, Yadav was the state co-secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (Madhya Pradesh) and a member of the national executive. He was the State Minister of the State Unit of the Council in 1989-90 and the National Minister of the Council in the year 1991-92. In 1993-95, he served as the functionary (Sangh Karyavah) of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in Ujjain Nagar. Additionally, his appointment was also seen as a major signal of political empowerment for the Yadav community, a dominant political force in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, however, have lacked proper proportional representation owing to the family-oriented politics of Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Janta Dal (RJD). Similarly, Vishnu Deo Sai, the next CM-designate of Chhattisgarh held the top organisational post in BJP’s Chhattisgarh unit. He served as Chhattisgarh BJP President from 2006 to 2013. His appointment also signalled a strong empowerment for the tribal community which was earlier witnessed when BJP-led NDA picked Droupadi Murmu for the Presidential post.   With all these new appointments, BJP signals that its motto ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas’ (inclusivity) will be counter to the opposition’s push for caste census and proportional representation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Center redefines terrorism in new criminal code, includes actions that threaten India’s economic security: Report ",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/center-redefines-terrorism-includes-actions-threatens-india-economic-security/,"The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionaryOn 12th December (Tuesday), the Union government revamped the legal definition of “a terrorist act”. Any action threatening India’s economic security will be treated as a ‘terrorist act’ under the new criminal code. The definition now includes threats to the economic and monetary security of the country through actions like using counterfeit currency or kidnapping, injuring, or causing the death of a public functionary, as reported by NDTV.#NewCriminalCode pic.twitter.com/g30k36MjeIAccording to Section 113 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, those who threaten, or are likely to threaten, the country by causing “damage to the monetary stability of India, by way of production or smuggling or circulation of counterfeit Indian paper currency…” commit a terrorist act.Notably, on 11th December, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had notified Lok Sabha that the three criminal law bills would be withdrawn. He added that the bills would be replaced with three new bills to incorporate the recommendations proposed by a parliamentary committee. Pertinent to note that the revised versions of all three were tabled in the Lok Sabha this evening (12th December).A Statement from the office of the Home Minister had said, “The bill (Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, and Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita) was referred to Department related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs on August 18 for consideration. The Committee held several rounds of discussion with the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Law and Justice, domain experts, and various stakeholders and submitted its reports along with recommendations on November 10.”Apart from revamping the definition of terrorist act, the government has added two new sections to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It is one of three bills that is now slated to replace current criminal laws, including the Code of Criminal Procedure. As per media reports, the first addition is the inclusion of Section 86. This newly added section includes harming a woman’s mental health in its definition of “cruelty”. Section 85 provided a three-year jail term for a husband, or members of his family, found guilty of subjecting his wife to cruel treatment in the previous version of the bill. However, the previous version didn’t define “cruel treatment” which has now been included, and the definition, significantly, extends to harming the woman’s mental health as well as her physical well-being. The second section prescribes a two-year imprisonment for disclosing the identity of a sexual assault victim from court proceedings without their consent.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ",K Annamalai slams temple management and HR&CE over attack on Sabarimala devotees at Tamil Nadu’s Srirangam temple,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/k-annamalai-slams-temple-management-and-hrce-over-attack-on-sabarimala-devotees-at-srirangam-temple/,"Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.On 12th December (Tuesday), temple management staff and police allegedly manhandled and assaulted devotees in the Trichy Srirangam Temple premises, in Tamil Nadu. The injured Ayyappa devotees have been admitted to Srirangam Government Hospital for treatment. Notably, the Vaikuntha Ekadasi festival in Srirangam began today with the Tirunedum Thandakam festival and thousands of devotees visited Ranganatha in the morning. As per reports, an argument that turned violent broke out between Ayyappa devotees from Karnataka and Andhra and the temporary staff appointed by the temple administration.Several devotees, including Andhra Ayyappa Bakhtar Chenna Rao, were assaulted. Following this, Ayyappa devotees filed a police complaint against three temporary employees Selvam, Vignesh, and Bharat who are accused of assaulting the devotees as well as against the temple administration. As per reports, it is alleged that the police deployed in the temple premises, instead of supporting the assaulted Ayyappa devotees, supported the accused temple staff. They reportedly pushed the injured devotees out of the temple and tried to cover up the attack. Subsequently, more than a hundred Ayyappa devotees protested at places like Karthikai Gopuram and Flagpole against the assault on devotees and mismanagement. However, the police reportedly stopped Ayyappa devotees who were protesting. A video footage of the incident is going viral on social media which has created a stir among the devotees. Sharing the video of an injured Ayyappa devotee, BJP state president K Annamalai condemned the incident. He also launched a scathing attack on temple management authorities including Tamil Nadu’s Hindu Religious & Charitable Endowments Department (HR & CE). Annamalai asserted that a government that doesn’t believe in Hindu dharma has no business to oversee or control the management of Hindu temples. Taking to X, he wrote, “A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples. The Iyyappa devotees who have had 42 days of Vrath, with all devotion, wanted to pray to Ranganatha Swamy after their return from Sabarimala. The Iyyappa devotees questioned the long wait in the queue and special treatment to a select few who were assaulted near the sanctum sanctorum & which resulted in bloodshed inside the Temple premises.”  A government which has no faith in Hindu Dharma has no business to be in Hindu Temples.

Tamil Nadu BJP’s Trichy district unit will today hold a protest outside the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy Temple against the TN HR&CE department, demanding the strictest action against those spoiling the sanctity of the Temple.” Meanwhile, Ayyappa devotees and opposition parties have been accusing the state governments of sabotaging the Sabarimala pilgrimage. Apart from Tamil Nadu, in Kerala, the opposition leaders have alleged that the Kerala Police have been diverted to ensure the statewide trip of CM Pinnrayi Vijayan rather than providing adequate police security for management and crowd control at Sabarimala pilgrimage. The devotees have been waiting for more than 20 hours in long queues. Several videos are doing rounds on the internet in which devotees have highlighted mismanagement for this year’s Sabarimala pilgrimage. In many cases, the police and temple management authorities have manhandled devotees for highlighting these issues. Reportedly, the devotees are facing an acute shortage of basic amenities like clean water and food, and one 11-year-old girl child died.  Fate of Ayyappa Devotees in Kerala !!!As u all know sabarimala pilgrimage is a significant annual Hindu pilgrimage in Kerala attracting millions of devotees.

He stated that the Vijayan government has ignored the Sabarimala pilgrimage for its own vested interests as the pilgrims are having a very tough time with facilities appallingly poor.The neglect of basic facilities in Sabarimala by the Pinarayi government is appalling – lack of crowd control, no drinking water, inadequate amenities. @pinarayivijayan is putting political interests over devotees' safety.

Another feature is the pilgrims from other states coming under duress from the police force. The Vijayan government is now showing its anger towards the believers for their combined efforts to ensure all the religious protocols in place in Sabarimala are intact, which they got from the court. Vijayan government has to change its attitude and ensure all facilities are there for the pilgrims.” Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The images of the carcasses were also attached.The HC bench expressed shock at the incident and directed authorities to examine the issue and submit a report.Remarking the incident to be “shocking, very shocking”, Justice Shastri said, “We feel, under the guise of regulating and implementing policy, these innocent animals cannot be sacrificed…if this is happening, even God will not save all of us, forgive us. These innocent animals cannot be done away like this…Not a single innocent animal is to be sacrificed on account of public comfort. It is an urgent situation that has erupted.”The Advocate General has reportedly promised action and informed that court that such acts are “at the behest of some miscreants”. He said that authorities will find out “who the miscreants are”.Meanwhile the matter has been kept for 13th December. Authorities are expected to present details on the condition of cattle pounds’ and action taken concerning the Nadiad incident.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","No need for fictional ‘Money Heist’, we have the Congress party: PM Modi takes a dig at decades of corruption under Congress governments",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/no-need-for-fictional-money-heist-we-have-the-congress-party-pm-modi/,"Following the IT raids which unearthed hundreds of crores of cash from Sahu’s properties, Congress claimed that it had nothing to do with his businessesOn 12th December (Tuesday), Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on the Congress party accusing it of pulling heists for more than seven decades. Taking to X, PM Modi argued that India doesn’t need fictional series like ‘Money Heist’ as it has the Congress party doing ‘legendary’ heists for 70 years and counting. PM Modi said, “In India, who needs ‘Money Heist’ fiction, when you have the Congress Party, whose heists are legendary for 70 years and counting!”In India, who needs 'Money Heist' fiction, when you have the Congress Party, whose heists are legendary for 70 years and counting! https://t.co/J70MCA5lcGPM Modi made the above remarks while quoting a tweet shared by the official Twitter handle of the BJP. The quoted tweet had a video embedded in it. Congress presents the 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐘 𝐇𝐄𝐈𝐒𝐓! pic.twitter.com/vp3BTheoshThe video highlighted the recent IT raids on Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Sahu. Notably, the counting of seized money from these raids on premises linked with the Congress leader is still ongoing on the 7th day. As per reports, it could breach the Rs 500 crore mark.   BJP’s tweet caption read, “Congress presents the 𝐌𝐎𝐍𝐄𝐘 𝐇𝐄𝐈𝐒𝐓!”. In the background, the video had the famous title track of the popular Spanish series ‘La Casa De Papel’ whose English spin-off ‘Money Heist’ has been among the most-watched series on OTT platforms. Incidentally, the series revolves around robbing banks. Cornering the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi for their alleged closeness and support to party MP Dhiraj Sahu, the video shows the latter’s picture with Rahul Gandhi and party president Mallikarjun Kharge. BJP has been lambasting the grand old party for indulging in rampant corruption and asserting that it can’t run away from accountability for the recent disclosures of huge piles of unaccounted cash from the properties of its Rajya Sabha MP.  Notably, following the IT raids which unearthed hundreds of crores of cash from Sahu’s properties, Congress claimed that it had nothing to do with his businesses and only the accused could explain the source of such a huge pile of cash.देशवासी इन नोटों के ढेर को देखें और फिर इनके नेताओं के ईमानदारी के 'भाषणों' को सुनें… 😂😂😂जनता से जो लूटा है, उसकी पाई-पाई लौटानी पड़ेगी, यह मोदी की गारंटी है। ❌❌❌💵 💵 💵❌❌❌ pic.twitter.com/O2pEA4QTOjEarlier, PM Modi had slammed the Congress party while referring to the reports of Income Tax raids on Congress MP Dhiraj Sahu.

"12 December, 2023 ",Ram Mandir priest Mohit Pandey defamed in fake porn pics: Gujarat Congress leader held for sharing morphed pictures,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/gujarat-congress-leader-hiten-pithadiya-held-for-sharing-morphed-pictures-of-ram-mandir-priest-with-a-woman/,"The Cyber Crime Branch of the Ahmedabad police apprehended the Congress leader Hiten Pithadiya on charges of disseminating manipulated images featuring a woman and the Ayodhya priest on various social media platforms.The Ahmedabad Police have arrested Gujarat Congress leader Hiten Pithadiya for sharing an obscene picture of a porn hero, projecting him as the priest of the under-construction Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. The Uttar Pradesh police have also initiated action against the leader for malicious posts against the Ram Mandir priest.On 11th December, Congress party leader Hiten Pithadiya shared some inappropriate photographs on social media and claimed that the person in the photographs was Mohit Pandey from Ghaziabad, who has been recently appointed as the priest for the Ram Lalla Temple being built in Ayodhya. Notably, since Pandey’s appointment, a malicious campaign has been running against him on social media. Apart from Pithaidya, several other X handles shared the same fake photos.Pithadiya is the head of the Scheduled Caste Morch of Gujarat Congress. In his post on X, he posted photographs of a person seen in an objectionable position with a woman. He wrote, “Is this the priest of Ayodhya Ram Temple?”The assertions were made based on the fact that the person in the photographs was wearing tilak and sandalwood. Earlier, real pictures of Pandey were shared on social media where he was wearing tilak and sandalwood. Pithadiya and others made fake claims based on the common factors of tilak and sandalwood. In reality, the person in the photograph was not Pandey.Following the controversy, Hindus on social media shared screenshots of the objectionable tweets. They urged police in Ayodhya and Ahmedabad to take strict action against those spreading the disinformation against Mohit Pandey.प्रभारी निरीक्षक साइबर सेल को आवश्यक जॉच व नियमानुसार विधिक कार्यवाही हेतु निर्देशित किया गया।It was evident that Pithadiya shared the photographs because of his bias against the Ram Temple and the newly appointed priest Mohit Pandey. Following the backlash, Pithadiya deleted his tweets. However, by that time, the damage was done. Both Ayodhya Police and Ahmedabad Police initiated action against Pithadiya.Journalist Janak Dave said in a post on X that Ahmedabad Cyber Cell arrested Pithadiya under Sections 469, 509, 295A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant IT Act.कांग्रेस नेता हितेन्द्र पिठाड़िया की गिरफ़्तारी.IPC 469, 509,IPC 295A और IT act के तहत मामला दर्ज. https://t.co/Ju8tfynPfO pic.twitter.com/GeZrL25633The Cyber Crime Branch of the Ahmedabad police apprehended the Congress leader on charges of disseminating manipulated images featuring a woman and the Ayodhya priest on various social media platforms.Verifying the information, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Cyber Crime, Ajit Rajian informed Deccan Herald that Hitendra Pithadiya has been arrested on charges of sharing deepfake images of the woman. The charges include 469 (forgery), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of a woman), 295 A (Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings), and relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.Mohit Pandey is a young priest selected to serve at the Ram Lalla Temple built in Ayodhya. Pandey studied at the Dudheshwar Vedic University in Ghaziabad for seven years. He earned his Shastri degree, equivalent to a Bachelor’s degree, from Shri Venkateshwara Vedic University, associated with the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam in Tirupati. He completed his master’s degree while studying Samaveda.

"12 December, 2023 ",‘Uddhav met Modi and promised to leave MVA to form govt with BJP in June 2021’: Education Minister in Shivsena MLAs disqualification case,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/uddhav-met-modi-promised-to-leave-mva-to-form-govt-with-bjp-in-june-2021-edu-min-deepak-kesarkar/,"As per the Minister, Uddhav Thackeray, the then-chief minister, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on 8th June 2021. Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister, and Ashok Chavan, a Cabinet Minister, were both present, Deepak Kesarkar claimed in his testimony to Speaker in the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification case. “Narendra Modi and Uddhav Thackeray met in June 2021. At that time, Uddhav Thackeray had promised Modi that he would leave the Mahavikas Aghadi and form the government with the BJP,” revealed Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar, the Shinde faction MLA while the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification hearing was underway. Deepak Kesarkar was cross-examined after Uday Samant in the Assembly on 11th December. He brought up the behind-the-scenes events that took place to form the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance at that time.The hearing of the Shiv Sena MLA disqualification case is underway before Assembly Speaker Rahul Narvekar. Uday Samant was cross-examined on Monday morning (11th December) and after that, Cabinet Minister Deepak Kesarkar was cross-examined.“I raised the issue of Shiv Sena Party’s objectives and ideology. I had changed Uddhav Thackeray’s mind by saying that BJP is a like-minded party and we should go with the alliance,” Kesarkar said while in the Assembly. As per the Minister, Uddhav Thackeray, the then-chief minister, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met on 8th June 2021. Ajit Pawar, the Deputy Chief Minister, and Ashok Chavan, a Cabinet Minister, were both present. The three leaders’ meeting with Prime Minister Modi came to an end. Following that, Modi and Thackeray had a meeting.Uddhav Thackeray was going to join hands with the BJP and leave the Maha Vikas Aghadi. He had also sought 15 days after his meeting with Prime Minister Modi. However, he arranged to send a message to Prime Minister Modi through me to ask for more time. He wanted some time to explain the decision to the alliance members. I arranged for his message to reach Delhi. Most of the Shiv Sena leaders wanted to be in alliance with BJP, Kesarkar revealed. Kesarkar further asserted that Uddhav Thackeray took a lot of time in making the decision and hence, he disclosed the information to some senior party leaders including Subhash Desai, Anil Desai and Eknath Shinde. “I asked them to request Uddhav Thackeray to decide at the earliest”, Kesarkar said in cross-examination.The Supreme Court on 30th October ordered Maharashtra assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to decide on the disqualification petitions against Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde and MLAs supporting him by 31st December. Earlier to that, the court had pulled up Narwekar for delaying the adjudication of the disqualification petitions. The court said it would fix a timeline if the speaker fails to submit a revised schedule expediting the process. The court also issued a warning that a decision on the disqualification pleas should taken before the next assembly elections, otherwise, the whole process would become pointless. After Shinde and 39 MLAs broke away from the parent party and sided with the BJP to form the government in 2022, the Sena factions filed an abundance of disqualification petitions against each other.In July, the speaker summoned 40 MLAs from the Shinde-led Sena and 14 from the Thackeray faction to respond to disqualification petitions filed against them. A total of 54 MLAs were served with the notices. On May 11, this year, the Supreme Court determined that Shinde would remain as Maharashtra’s chief minister. It also stated that it could not reinstate Thackeray’s Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) coalition government because he chose to resign without facing a floor test in the aftermath of Shinde’s rebellion.The Shiv Sena (UBT) however accused Narwekar of purposefully delaying a decision on the disqualification petitions.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Did Washington Post repeat Pakistani conspiracy theory about ‘Disinfo Lab’? Copy-paste journalism, reliance on lunatic who wanted Mamata Banerjee raped, claims about ‘SkinDoctor’",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-disinfo-lab-article-on-pakistani-conspiracy-theory/,"Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Aveek Sen's misleading tweets on 'Disinfo Lab' became the primary fodder for both 'Pakistani Defence' and 'The Washington Post'.A day after The Washington Post carried out a hit job on Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab’, it has come to light that some of the outlandish claims made by the American newspaper bear an uncanny resemblance to conspiracy theories peddled by a Pakistani website.In an attempt to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’, The Washington Post claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.Although it relied on word salad, insinuations, ‘source-based’ allegations and dubious ‘experts’, the American newspaper failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of ‘Disinfo Lab.’Interestingly, a large part of the purported ‘investigation’ by The Washington Post on the Indian OSINT handle appears to be based on conspiracy theories peddled by a website named ‘Pakistan Defence.’In an article titled ‘Disinfo Lab – A Disinformation Project of Indian RA&W’, published by the website in February 2022, a staff writer Amaa’n relied on outlandish claims made by ‘journalist’ Aveek Sen to draw links between ‘Disinfo Lab’ and Indian Intelligence.The ‘Pakistan Defence’ article made references to Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy, Ajayendra Tripathi, and BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga – all of whom appear prominently in the propaganda piece of The Washington Post.The Pakistani website presented the accusations of Aveek Sen, an abusive troll, as the ‘gospel truth.’ In the tweet from 2013 that went viral, Aveek Sen was seen quoting TimesNow, saying that Mamata Banerjee had called the Barasat rapists ‘CPIM supporters’. To that, Aveek Sen had responded saying “Its high time these cpm supporters rape Mamata!”Prior to deleting his account, Aveek Sen had made several dergatory comments targeting women. A few of his archived misogynist tweets can be seen here – In several of his tweets, Aveek Sen was seen referring to women as ‘prostitutes.’Despite his questionable character and dwindling credibility, Sen’s misleading tweets on ‘Disinfo Lab’ became the primary fodder for both ‘Pakistani Defence’ and ‘The Washington Post’. Interestingly, he had also collaborated with the likes of propaganda outlets such as Newslaundry.“And the making of Indian fake disinfo lab, copying the famous eu disinfo lab that exposed hundreds and thousands of fake Indian websites (By author Aveek sen),” read a line from the article on ‘Pakistan Defence.’Coincidentally, a similar language is used in the report published by The Washington Post. “Another person, a former employee, said the Disinfo Lab named and modelled itself after groups such as the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based nonprofit that researches disinformation targeting Europe,” it claimed.It claimed, “Some of the fronts, setup by Colonel Dibya Satpathy, per Aveek Sen’s revelation, include: Root N Wings Media, situated at B-3, Bali’s, Near BSES Office, Arya Samaj Mandir, Lajpat Nagar 2, Delhi. Flat A-20, Lajpat Nagar 3, near Ring Road, Delhi.”Interestingly, the claims made it to the report of The Washington Post as well. “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors working out of a four-story whitewashed building on a leafy street in New Delhi,” the leftist newspaper wrote.In another paragraph, it said, “The office operated under the name Root and Wings Media.” Based on Aveek Sen’s tweets, the shady Pakistani website alleged that Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy had been campaigning against the country on the behest of R&AW and BJP.OpIndia found yet another uncanny resemblance in the report of The Washington Post where it said, “The Disinfo Lab itself was headed by Satpathy, whose work has focused mostly on countering Pakistan.”“The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” the American newspaper claimed in another part of the article.Both The Washington Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ made specific references to ‘Root Wings Media’ and characterised it as a ‘social media marketing company/ campaign agency.’“The company has no more than ten employees, typical of an intelligence front,” the Pakistani website said. And this is what the American newspaper claimed – “The Disinfo Lab, which at one point consisted of about a dozen private contractors.” Both The Washingon Post and ‘Pakistan Defence’ targeted targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.“Some of the investigative reports published by this website include one aiming to discredit the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom,” wrote ‘Pakistan Defence.’“The Disinfo Lab often cites publicly available U.S. lobbying and campaign finance records and produces complex flowcharts to illustrate alleged relationships. But the group draws tenuous connections, claiming, for instance, that a USCIRF commissioner was influenced by Islamists because she once worked on a conservative fundraising committee alongside a lobbyist who went on to represent Muslim American groups,” claimed The Washington Post.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.The Washington Post ensured to not include all conspiracy theories to set its ‘investigative article’ apart from that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ The Pakistani website had even dubbed popular member and dermatologist Neelam Singh aka ‘The Skin Doctor’ as an aide to R&AW officer Lt. Colonel Dibya Satpathy.“The Evil nexus of Col Dibya Satpathy Indian ex-military intelligence officer and bjp troll farms. To (sic) manufacture and spread propaganda and misinformation with the help of Major Neelam “Neel” Kumari alias “The Skin Doctor”, Major Gaurav Arya,” it claimed.‘Pakistan Defence’ accused ‘The Skin Doctor’ of carrying out the ‘evil nexus’ of supposed ‘Disinfo Lab’ founder and Indian Intelligence officerThe Washington Post did not copy-paste the outrageous claims about ‘Disinfo Lab’ only from ‘Pakistan Defence’ but another Pakistani-based website named ‘Centre for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR).Interestingly, CSCR published another misleading piece on ‘Disinfo Lab’ a year before that of ‘Pakistan Defence.’ Habitual fake news peddler and anti-Hindu activist CJ Werleman had made similar insinuations about the Indian OSINT handle in February last year.First, the claim of our association with Govt agencies/ RAW. The report is essentially a recycle of previous reports published by Pakistani ISPR/ Info-war machinery. The report is periodically recycled, last by known fake news peddler CJ Werleman.Lazy Journalism!(2/n) pic.twitter.com/0oXNGfrVyoIn November 2021, CJ Werleman had appealed to boycott Indian products to supposedly ‘save’ Muslims in India and Kashmir. Before that, he had tweeted a video of Pramod Muthalik, the chief of the Hindu activist group Shri Rama Sene, to allege that he called for violence against Muslims and the demolition of a mosque in Karnataka. Earlier, he claimed Indians had destroyed a Muslim graveyard in Himachal Pradesh, which was also fake news. In August 2021 when the Islamist group Taliban took over Afghanistan, Werleman was caught spreading Taliban propaganda. In September 2021, he called for ‘regime decapitation’ strikes against India.The Print, run by Shekhar Gupta had eulogised Werleman in a profile describing him as a ‘bigot-turned-crusader against ‘Islamophobia’ who is taking on the Indian state’. Since every anti-India propagandist is a potential source of The Washington Post, there will surely be no dearth of more anti-India hit pieces ahead of the 2024 elections.While hitting out at The Washington Post, ‘Disinfo Lab’ pointed out that the only difference in its article and past hitjobs against it is the addition of unnamed sources. “The only ‘upgrade’ the WaPo did was to make this Pakistani allegation ‘anonymous’. And whatever is in addition to that is again attributed to ‘anonymous’ sources. Hence, literally, every fact claimed is ‘anonymous’. The report has more than 10 anonymous sources,” it added.As pointed out earlier by OpIndia, The Washington Post failed to refute any assertions made by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ It also noted, “While, in their questions to us and other people, WaPo journalists have themselves noted that our claims are factually correct! (thanks for acknowledgement), they alleged that we make ‘tenuous claims’, and cited a few examples.”While calling out the bluff of the leftist newspaper, Disinfo Lab concluded that The Washington Post is overrated. “It is not surprising that people who don’t understand OSINT are baffled by our reporting. It is especially hard for legacy media journos – Indian and foreign alike, who have known journalism only as handouts from sources. Agencies are overrated. OSINT is underrated,” it emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"12 December, 2023 ",Opposition forced to use ‘dirty money’ due to electoral bonds: Raghu Ram Rajan steps out to defend Congress MP linked to 500 cr Income...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/rbi-governor-raghu-ram-rajan-congress-income-tax/,"Dr Rajan, who joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's Bharat Jodo Yatra last year on the economy, came out in defence of UPA-2 and claimed that the country did not progress much during 2009-2014 because UPA-2 was not in the majority. In an interview published by The Red Mike on 12th December, former Governor of Reserve Bank of India, Dr Raghuram Rajan, gave a bizarre “context” to the unaccounted cash recovered from Congress Rajya Sabha MP Dhiraj Prasad Sahu. Dr Rajan claimed that the opposition parties are “forced” to use illicit money because electoral bonds provide an unequal playing field favouring the ruling party.In his question, Sanket Upadhyay asked Dr Rajan about his views on electoral bonds, citing the statement given by former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg at Idea Exchange. Garg thoroughly explained why electoral bonds were introduced and what the ill effects of removing them from the system would be. Sanket asked Dr Rajan about his views on the statement where Garg said that if electoral bonds are removed, it will be cash on the streets yearly in the political process.Dr Rajan asserted electoral bonds are an utterly non-transparent way of financing. Parties receive funds, and what they get is not known to anyone. In case an industrialist gives 1,000 crores to a party, the public can never know. He further called it a “bad way of financing elections” as the only people who know who donated what are the State Bank of India. He claimed that in India, it is hard to maintain secrets, and the ruling party can find the information of the business houses that donated to the opposition parties.Dr Rajan speaks on the Dheeraj Sahu cash recovery in the context of Electoral Bonds. Do listen to his views below. Full intw – https://t.co/HTcXOGc7cW pic.twitter.com/cD9yHKKTUoDr Rajan said, “I do not say it happens, but the ruling party can call up the people who gave money to the opposition parties and ask them why they donated to so and so party.” He further claimed that this is why opposition parties must use cash instead of electoral bonds. “Elections are fought on money,” he added.Furthermore, he said that for the elections, the ruling party could use agencies like the Enforcement Directorate, the Income Tax Department, and the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct raids against the leaders of the opposition parties. For example, in the recent attacks against Dhiraj Prasad Sahu, Dr Rajan asserted that the money could have been used to fight elections.What is notable here is that even the Congress party could not develop this bizarre theory. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh categorically stated the party had nothing to do with the money recovered from premises linked to Sahu. While the Congress party distanced itself from the controversy, Dr Rajan felt it necessary to explain why so much cash was stored at premises linked to Sahu.Dr Rajan, who joined Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra last year on the economy, came out in defence of UPA-2 and claimed that the country did not progress much during 2009-2014 because UPA-2 was not in the majority. He said that Goods and Service Tax (GST) was introduced during UPA-2 but could not be implemented as opposition parties opposed it. UPA-2 was not in the majority, so it could not be made a law. Notably, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was in opposition then. Can you believe?Raghuram Rajan now says policy paralysis of UPA 2 was fault of opposition!He is crying that UPA did not have big enough majorityLOL… Nehru dynasty had big majorities for 40 years… they took India's economy DOWN from 6th to 12th largest! pic.twitter.com/XlLfXhz9xJIn a way, he blamed the BJP for the “policy paralysis” during UPA-2. Rajan said, “Parliament was not allowed to function. You can’t solely point a finger and say nothing happened. There was partial paralysis; that was was opposition-led also.”Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a Rajya Sabha MP for Congress from Jharkhand. His family has been associated with the Congress party since independence. He became Rajya Sabha MP in by-polls in 2009 for the first time. In 2010, he was re-elected as RS MP for the second time; in 2018, he was re-elected for RS by Congress for the third time.Dhiraj Sahu actively participates in parliamentary proceedings. Sahu was also part of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra. In recent raids at Odisha-based Boudh Distillery Pvt Ltd, where Dhiraj Prasad Sahu is a partner, the Income Tax Department recovered over 400 cr of unaccounted cash. Congress Party has distanced itself from their own MP after the recovery of the cash.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

There are no substantially approved rules and regulations on proper conduct and discipline of students by the statutory body (i.e Executive Council) of JNU in vogue.”The pamphlet mentioned that a student (repeat offender) would be expelled if he or she was awarded 5 (five) or more punishments during the entire duration of the study.Punishments have been listed for 28 types of “misconduct”, including blockage, indulging in gambling, unauthorised occupation of hostel rooms, use of abusive and derogatory language and committing forgery.For hunger strikes, dharnas, group bargaining and any other form of protest by blocking the entrance or exit of any of the academic and/or administrative complexes or disrupting the movements of any member of the University community, a fine of up to Rs 20,000 will be levied.Students can be fined up to Rs 6,000 for holding events without prior permission, and/or they may have to carry out JNU Community Service.For printing, circulating or pasting posters/pamphlets (text or picture) carrying derogatory religious, communal, casteist or anti-national remarks and any activity that incites intolerance towards religion, caste or community and/or anti-national in nature which disturbs the peaceful atmosphere on the campus, a student can be fined upto Rs 10,000.The JNU Students Union has condemned the new manual saying it is aimed at stifling the vibrant campus culture that has defined the university for decades.“Such excessive regulations are intended to discourage open discussions, dissent, and intellectual exploration, which are fundamental to the spirit of our university. According to the new manual, protests before any academic building can lead to rustication, eviction from the hostel and a fine of Rs 20,000. Moreover, a student who commits any act that the JNU Admin considers to be of moral turpitude can be fined up to Rs 10,000,” the statement read.

On the fateful day, when she was at the tea stall, the woman asked the latter to get her phone charged.

On his suggestion, the woman put her mobile phone on charging and waited for it to complete,” the DCP said. Meanwhile, the driver of the ambulance took away the vehicle from service to transport a patient. When the woman inquired Satyam about her phone hours later, he informed her that the ambulance was at Daliganj.

"12 December, 2023 ","Harvard President Claudine Gay, who tried to give ‘context’ on genocide calls against Jews, accused of plagiarising her Ph.D. thesis",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/harvard-president-claudine-gay-who-tried-to-give-context-on-genocidecalls-against-jews-accused-of-plagiarising-her-ph-d-thesis/,"The report alleges that Gay had violated Harvard's policy on plagiarism throughout her dissertation Harvard University President Dr Claudine Gay who is barely out of one controversy is now facing a new charge. A report has alleged that Dr Gay plagiarised parts of her 1997 Ph.D. thesis.City Journal writer Christopher F Rufo, along with contributing editor of American Conservative Magazine Chris Brunet, released parts of the thesis and contrasted it with another paper.EXCLUSIVE: @RealChrisBrunet and I have obtained documentation demonstrating that Harvard President Claudine Gay plagiarized multiple sections of her Ph.D. thesis, violating Harvard's policies on academic integrity.This is a bombshell. 🧵The duo alleged that Gay has lifted an entire paragraph “nearly verbatim” from a paper by Lawrence Bobo and Franklin Gilliam’s, while passing it off as her own paraphrase and language. They substantiated this by sharing an image of the part in question and contrasting it with the study they claim Gay copied from.First, Gay lifts an entire paragraph nearly verbatim from a paper by Lawrence Bobo and Franklin Gilliam’s, while passing it off as her own paraphrase and language. This is a direct violation of Harvard's policy: ""When you paraphrase, your task is to distill the source’s ideas… pic.twitter.com/t6enHp3dN9In the thread post on X, Rufo and Brunet alleged that Gay had violated Harvard’s policy on plagiarism throughout her thesis document “using the work by Bobo and Gilliam as well as passages from Richard Shingles, Susan Howell, and Deborah Fagan, which she reproduces nearly verbatim, without quotation marks”.Gay repeats this violation of Harvard's policy throughout the document, again using work from Bobo and Gilliam, as well as passages from Richard Shingles, Susan Howell, and Deborah Fagan, which she reproduces nearly verbatim, without quotation marks. pic.twitter.com/K75YPeZwkyThey pointed out that at some parts Gay has not used quote marks while copying language from material published by Carol Swain. The appendix, they alleged, is taken directly from a book by Gary King.Later in the paper, Gay also uses identical language to Swain, without adding quotation marks, as required. ""Since the 1950s the reelection rate for House members has rarely dipped below 90 percent,"" reads Swain’s book, which is the same, excepting an added comma, to the language… pic.twitter.com/p6aM8776HhRufo said that Harvard’s policy states that “students who, for whatever reason, submit work either not their own or without clear attribution to its sources will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including requirement to withdraw from the College.These are flagrant violations of Harvard's plagiarism policy, which states that students who commit plagiarism will suffer ""disciplinary action, up to and including requirement to withdraw from the College."" The same standard should apply to the university president. pic.twitter.com/Q2UviANylT“Students who have been found responsible for any violation of these standards will not be permitted to submit course evaluation of the course in which the infraction occurred,” the policy states.Rufo demanded that the same policy should be applied by Harvard to the university president too just as it does to the students.Gay’s thesis advisor has reportedly called the accusation “absurd”. “There is not a conceivable case that this is plagiarism. Her dissertation and every draft I read of it met the highest academic standards,” said Professor Gary King.The entire case is garnering attention on social media and beyond thereby bringing into question the dwindling credibility of the Ivy League institute.This is the second such controversy in the past week that has plunged the credibility of Harvard University as well as its President.Calls are being made demanding the removal of Dr Claudine Gay from the position of President of Harvard University after she refused to give a yes or no answer at a house committee hearing on antisemitism on campuses.On 5th December at the congressional hearing on “Holding Campus Leaders Accountable and Confronting Antisemitism” in Washington, DC, Congresswoman Elise Stafanik confronted the Presidents of Harvard, Penn and MIT.She asked, “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate the university’s code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment” demanding a yes or no answer.Dr Claudine Gay responded saying that it “depends on the context”. She laid down the context when asked saying, “targeted as an individual, targeted at an individual”.She added, “Antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct, it amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation, that is actionable conduct and we do take action.”The Congresswoman reprimanded Gay and asked the latter to resign. She also said that the answers were unacceptable across the board owing to the similar replies given by the President of University of Penn Liz Magill and President of MIT, Sally Kornbluth.Penn President Liz Magill was forced to resign from her position where as Gay has only issued an apology so far saying, “I am sorry. Words matter. When words amplify distress and pain, I don’t know how you could feel anything but regret.”“I got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures. What I should have had the presence of mind to do at that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged. Substantively, I failed to convey what is my truth,” Gay said.However, as per reports, Harvard faculty members have put their weight behind Gay. A petition has been signed by more than 600 Harvard faculty members asking the governing body to not sack the President.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The petitioner asserted that Roy stated in an interview with Al Jazeera that “India was becoming a fascist Hindu enterprise.”A division bench consisting of Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharya noted that the plea had not been properly served on the respondents and ordered that it be listed after service had been executed on the respondents, which included Twitter Inc., whose name had subsequently been changed to “X Corp.”The petitioner contended that Roy had disclosed these remarks to Al Jazeera, which is ‘affiliated with Osama Bin Laden’s Al Qaeda’. Roy in the year-old video could also be heard calling the present rulers of India ‘gangsters’. “Millions of people follow her. She called the Indian government a “Hindu Fascist enterprise” in an interview with AI Jazeera, even though India is one of the few secular nations in the world. The people have mandated the government, and Osama Bin Laden’s Al Qaeda is represented by Al Jazeera. Thousands of people will share her speech, and renowned actor Prakash Raj has also referred to Hindus as fascists. Hindus are not fascists; we have learned dharma rakshite rakshita, which means we protect our dharma and it protects us,” the petitioner stated. After hearing the plea, the Chief Justice asked the petitioners if they had previously filed a similar plea with the Delhi High Court. Additionally, it was mentioned that not all respondents had received the service and that Twitter Inc., one of the respondents, would have to be freshly arrayed as X Corp in the writ petition. Meanwhile, the legal representative for the petitioner maintained that these remarks ‘don’t make any sense.’Taking issue with these remarks, the plea was adjourned after service was completed, and the Chief Justice rebuked orally: “Are you calling us senseless?” Or the State’s attorney? Never use that word, and how long have you been in practice? From 2006? Even in a Magistrates Court, do not use these expressions because they can lead to criminal contempt. You are appearing before the first court in a chartered High Court, India’s oldest. You’d better watch your language.

"12 December, 2023 ",“BJP MLAs bow down to Muslim Speaker in Karnataka”: Congress minister Zameer Ahmed Khan’s video causes uproar in Assembly,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/bjp-mlas-bow-down-to-muslim-speakerin-karnataka-congress-minister-zameer-ahmed-khans-video-causes-uproar-in-assembly/,"Leader of Opposition R Ashoka along with other BJP MLAs assembled at the Well of the House demanding that Khan be sacked for his ""insulting"" remark involving the position of the Speaker.Chaos broke out in the Karnataka Assembly on Monday over a video of a Congress minister who can be heard trying to communalise the Speaker’s chair. Zameer Ahmad Khan’s remarks during an election rally in Telangana were brought up in the House on Monday (11th December). BJP MLAs staged a protest in the assembly demanding the sacking of the Congress minister.The Housing, Waqf and Minority affairs minister BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan while targeting the BJP during the Telangana campaign had said that the BJP MLAs are now bound to join hands and bow down before a Muslim speaker in Karnataka thanks to the Congress.The video of his address had gathered pace on social media and garnered widespread criticism.“9 of us (Muslims) have been elected. 17 seats had Muslim contenders and 9 got elected. 5 have been given power. Zameer Ahmed Khan has been given three portfolios as minister, Raheem Khan has been made minister, Salin Ahmed has been made chief whip and Naseer Ahmed has recently been made political secretary. Till today, no one (Muslim) had been made Speaker. Today the Congress has made UT Khader Speaker. Today, BJP leaders join hands and salute before UT Khader (a Muslim leader) because of the Congress,” Khan said in his address.Leader of Opposition R Ashoka along with other BJP MLAs assembled at the Well of the House demanding that Khan be sacked for his “insulting” remark involving the position of the Speaker.He said, “We don’t know in which country we are living. Is this Pakistan? Khan should be sacked for showing BJP leaders in poor light.”JD(S) also joined in the chorus as the protests went on for the entire duration of the House proceedings.However, Speaker UT Khader did not heed the Opposition’s demand and the House passed five bills without discussion and concluded a discussion on drought with the government’s reply.Meanwhile, the BJP also accused the Speaker of conducting the proceedings in a dictatorial manner like a “Congress Speaker” and insulting the Opposition. The BJP MLAs called the Congress minister’s statement as “anti constitution and anti Hindu”.LoP R Ashoka also accused Khan of disrespecting the chair of the Speaker and trying to disturb the sentiments of Hindus and Muslims. A battle ensued in the assembly when Congress MLAs also rose in protest against the Opposition.“Are we (BJP MLAs) gulams (slaves)? To say salaam the way he (Khan) has said,” R Ashoka asked. BJP MLA and former Karnataka minister CN Ashwath Narayan demanded Khan’s suspension from the assembly.Meanwhile, the Speaker, UT Khader, himself told the Opposition that they should have raised the matter after giving a notice. Even as the assembly was adjourned for some time, the House proceedings continued later without heeding to the demands of the opposition.“We respect the chair not because the speaker who occupies it is a Hindu or a Muslim. It is because of respect towards the Chair. The minister’s statement has humiliated Hindus, so Khan has to apologise. Extend the session by a week for discussion on key issues, but we won’t take back protests,” Ashoka said.The BJP also called Khan a “Pakistani agent”. The LoP asked whether Congress is ashamed to take action when Hindus are insulted.Zameer Ahmed Khan has reportedly refused to issue an apology or submit resignation. He was quoted as saying, “I had said that Congress, BJP, and JD(S) members bow down to the Speaker’s chair and respect it. I have merely highlighted that the Congress has elevated the Muslim community to such a high post. What’s wrong with that statement?”About a year ago, the Congress minister had made headlines for his unheygenic display of appeasement. While marking Ambedkar Jayanti and Eid Milan at an event last year, Khan was seen in a video feeding a morsel of food to a Dalit priest, asked him to spit it out and then ate it himself.The video had gone viral on social media.Last year, the Congress leader had claimed that the numerical strength of Muslims is greater than the politically-dominant Vokkaliga community in the state.He made the contentious remarks to support Siddaramaiah’s bid for becoming the Congress’ CM candidate in the Assembly elections.In July 2022, the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) conducted raids on the residence and office of the Congress MLA in Bengaluru. The ACB officials also registered a case against Khan in the disproportionate assets case and booked him based on ED’s report.The ACB officials raided 2 offices and 3 residential properties of Khan which include his residence in the Bengaluru Cantonment area, a flat in Silver Oak Apartment, a guest house at Sadashiv Nagar, GK Associates office at Banashankari, and National Travels Office in Kalasipalya in Bengaluru.Khan along with several other Congress leaders was seen brandishing swords during the so-called celebration of Islamic tyrant Tipu Sultan at Bengaluru. BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan, a Congress MLA from Chamarajpet, addressed the media while holding a sword.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"12 December, 2023 ","Delhi High Court dismisses China-funded NewsClick’s plea challenging orders passed by Income Tax Dept, demanding stay: Details",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/delhi-high-court-dismisses-china-funded-newsclick-plea-challenging-orders-income-tax-dept/,"NewsClick had prayed for a stay of demand during the pendency of the petitioner's appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The Delhi High Court has dismissed the News Portal NewsClick plea challenging the orders dated November 3 and February 20 passed by the Income Tax Department and said it has not been able to make out a prima facie case in its favour. The bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Mini Pushkarna, while passing the order recently, said that the petitioner’s plea of financial stringency based on its balance sheet also inspires no confidence, as according to the Assessing Officer, the accounts have not been properly maintained. To put it mildly, the petitioner has a ‘lot to answer’ in the appeal, said the bench. Newclick recently approached the Delhi High Court, challenging the orders dated November 3rd and February 20th, passed by the respondents, whereby the petitioner’s application for a stay of demand during the pendency of the appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) against the assessment order dated December 30th, 2022, has been dismissed. The petitioner had further prayed for a stay of demand during the pendency of the petitioner’s appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). Senior Advocate Devdutt Kamat appeared for the petitioner and submitted that the discretion to stay the demand during the pendency of an appeal has to be exercised judiciously and reasonably, based on relevant grounds, with due application of mind, and must not be exercised arbitrarily, capriciously or based on irrelevant considerations. He states that in complete violation of this mandate, the impugned orders are arbitrary, have been passed mechanically, and suffer from complete non-application of mind. Recently, the Delhi Police special cell arrested NewsClick’s founder and Editor-in-Chief Prabir Purkayastha and HR Head Amit Chakravarty under Sections IPC and UAPA. The Delhi Police’s Special Cell, in its FIR against news web portal NewsClick’s founder and Editor-in-Chief Prabir Purkayastha, stated that the People’s Dispatch Portal, owned and maintained by M/S PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt Ltd, has been used for intentionally peddling false narratives through paid news in lieu of crores of rupees of illegally routed foreign funds as part of a conspiracy. The Delhi Police FIR further stated that foreign funds in crores have been infused illegally in India by Indian and foreign entities inimical to India in pursuance of a conspiracy with the intention to disrupt the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India, to cause disaffection against India and to threaten the unity, integrity, and security of India. Foreign funds in crores have been infused illegally in India by Indian and foreign entities inimical to India in pursuance of a conspiracy with the intention to disrupt the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India, to cause disaffection against India and to threaten the unity, integrity, and security of India, as stated in the FIR.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"12 December, 2023 ",HM Amit Shah likely to re-introduce amended three criminal law bills in Lok Sabha,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/hm-amit-shah-likely-to-re-introduce-amended-three-criminal-law-bills-in-lok-sabha-nyay-sanhita/,"The three criminal law bills seek to replace colonial-era criminal laws named the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.On 12th December, Union Home Minister Amit Shah will likely introduce three criminal law bills in Lok Sabha after amending them based on the standing committee’s recommendations. The three bills previously introduced in Lok Sabha on 11th August were withdrawn by the Home Minister on 11th December, subjected to the amendments. The three bills that will replace the colonial-era criminal laws are the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita Bill, 2023, and the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023.Hindustan Times quoted an unnamed source familiar with the matter saying, “Based on the committee’s recommendations, amendments have been proposed in the three criminal law bills, which the home minister will introduce along with two other bills around 5 pm on Tuesday.”Reportedly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his office disagreed with two of the proposed amendments as they were seen as against the Supreme Court and its judgments. The two suggestions aimed to criminalise adultery and homosexual sex. Notably, the Supreme Court had struck down the law that made adultery an offence, saying it was discriminating against women, perpetuating gender stereotypes and diminishing the dignity of women. Though the apex court had struck down the criminalisation of homosexual sex between consensual adults, the committee suggested retaining it in the new bill.Notably, after introducing the bills in August this year, they were sent to the standing committee on home affairs for review. The committee submitted a report on 6th November and proposed 50 amendments to the bills. Reportedly, HM Shah said in the Parliament, “Based on the committee’s recommendations, amendments are proposed in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023. It is proposed to introduce a new bill in place of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Bill, 2023.” Similar statements were made to withdraw the other two bills as well.The three criminal law bills seek to replace colonial-era criminal laws named the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.In August 2023, the Home Minister introduced three bills to replace the British-era criminal code in the country—the move aimed at removing colonial legacies, with 475 referencing the British Raj being eliminated.The notable changes in the law included a shift in the focus to crime against women and children with penalties for offences like gang rape and rape of minors, including the death penalty. Furthermore, measures against love jihad, organised crime, terrorism and mob lynching were introduced in the bills. Time-bound investigations, trials and judgments were part of the new bills to replace British-era criminal laws. The digitisation of the entire legal process, mandatory community service, and increased use of forensic science are also emphasised.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Ahmadullah, a deportee, called on Taliban to provide them with work. This comes as Iranian officials have said that Afghans without legal documents will be deported from Iran, TOLO News reported. More than 345,000 Afghans have been deported from Iran to Afghanistan in over two months, Afghanistan-based TOLO News reported, citing a senior official of the Taliban-led Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation. Abdul Rahman Rashid, Taliban-appointed Deputy Minister of Refugees and Repatriation, said, “Since the first of Mizan (23rd September) till 17 Qaws (December 8) there were approximately 345,000. Each family has been provided with 10,000 Afs in cash assistance by the Islamic Emirate.” Mohammad Yousuf and Fatih Khan, who left Afghanistan and went to Iran to make both ends meet, have been deported from Iran. They complained about the mistreatment of Afghan refugees by Iranian forces, according to TOLO News report. Yousuf said, “There was no work here, then we went to Iran through illegal paths. They beat us and detained us.” Khan said, “They captured us and beat us. They beat us badly and forced us to return.” The deportees raised concerns regarding the lack of employment in Afghanistan and urged the Taliban to make efforts to create jobs for the citizens. Shirin Agha, a deportee, said, “We call on our government to provide us with work so the people are not forced to leave.” Ahmadullah, a deportee, called on Taliban to provide them with work. This comes as Iranian officials have said that Afghans without legal documents will be deported from Iran, TOLO News reported. Last week, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Wahidi reiterated that Afghan citizens who are currently residing in Iran illegally should return to their country, according to TOLO News. However, Wahifi did not mention a group or a country but said that the “enemy” wants to start anti-Afghan sentiments by creating a conflict between Afghans and Iranians. He further highlighted that Iran’s capital, Tehran, has also planned for immigrants with documents, according to TOLO News. “When the Taliban came here, I told them that you should prepare the ground for them (Afghan immigrants) to return to their country. After all, everyone should return to their own lives. You should come up with a mechanism for their return, and they said to give us some time,” Wahidi said. Asifa Stanikzai, a women’s rights activist, said, “Different countries and organisations should continue their humanitarian aid to the refugees who need help, regardless of the internal conditions of Afghanistan.”(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Musk wrote, “I’m literally rofl rn.” Indian American businessman and GOP Presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy faced an embarrassing moment when he forgot to mute his mic while taking a ‘loo break’ from an active X (Twitter) space. Around 2.3 million listeners were tuned in when Ramaswamy encountered the hot mic moment. On the X (Twitter) Space, Ramaswamy was participating in a discussion on the future of technology. During the session, Elon Musk was explaining the rationale behind reinstating the banned X account of Alex Jones, founder of the website Infowars, back on his micro-blogging platform. However, interjecting in the conversation, Ramaswamy conveyed that he would have to take a short break, hurriedly stating, “Gentlemen, I have to go.” While Elon Musk continued the discussion, the unmistakable sound of running water could be heard in the background.Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy takes a piss with his mic on during an 𝕏 Space with 100K+ listenersElon Musk: “I hope you feel better”Vivek: “I feel great, thank you” pic.twitter.com/3ljslTqnpXPointing towards unusual noises, Alex Jones sarcastically remarked, “Someone’s got their thing open peeing.

But I am not able to mute you.” On returning from the short break, Vivek Ramaswamy realised that his mic was unmuted and understood what had transpired. He immediately apologised for the embarrassing moment. However, on a lighter note, Musk quips, “I hope you feel better now”. To which Ramaswamy replied, “I feel great.

"12 December, 2023 ",Washington Post and its hit job on ‘Disinfo Lab’: Exposing the nefarious campaign to discredit Indian OSINT handle before 2024 Lok Sabha election,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/washington-post-hitjob-against-disinfo-lab-anti-india-propaganda-before-2024-elections/,"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, The Washington Post has launched a campaign of sorts to de-legitimise those exposing anti-India narratives and promote individuals disseminating propaganda against India.On Sunday (10th December), the leftist media outlet carried out a hit job on the Indian OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) handle ‘Disinfo Lab.’ To this effect, it published an article titled ‘Covert Indian operation seeks to discredit Modi’s critics in the U.S.’The development comes two days after American political commentator Jack Posobiec revealed how The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Priyanshu Verma had been soliciting information about ‘Disinfo Lab.’‘Disinfo Lab’ is the same OSINT handle, which earlier exposed how the US State Department was relying on misleading data (sourced from Christian evangelist groups and radical Islamist outfits) to allege a decline in India’s religious freedom.It was thus obvious that US-based leftist media outlets such as The Washington Post would make attempts to de-legitimise ‘Disinfo Lab’ sooner or later. Based on ‘sources’, Pranshu Verma and his two other colleagues claimed on Sunday (10th December) that the OSINT handle is run by an Indian Intelligence Officer named Lt. Col. Dibya Satpathy.The trio at The Washington Post alleged that the objective of ‘Disinfo Lab’ is to ‘research and discredit foreign critics of the Modi government’, ‘combine fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims’, ‘intimidate individuals overseas’ and ‘run covert influence operation.’However, a cursory look at the website of the OSINT handle reveals that it is focused on uncovering disinformation campaigns, aimed at tarnishing the image of India on a global scale. Nevertheless, this did not stop The Washington Post from making sweeping claims about it. “The Disinfo Lab’s activities show how the online propaganda campaigns waged by the BJP and its allies have been expanding beyond their traditional, domestic aims of shoring up popular support and denigrating opposition parties — and now seek to influence attitudes far beyond India’s borders,” it brazened out.The leftist media outlet roped in several ‘experts’ to suggest that the Indian government led by PM Narendra Modi is using an OSINT handle with 45.6K followers to undermine political rivals and create a global narrative.One such expert was an ‘academic’ named Joyjeet Pal. He claimed, “The Indian right wing is a new player that has arrived on the world stage and wants to shape global discussion…So far, much of it is done in the same way it’s done within India — through crude, blunt force. But it’s getting smarter.” The Washinton Post introduced Pal as a University of Michigan Professor ‘who studies disinformation in India.’ Interestingly, he is the same ‘expert’ whose obscure research was used by Indian leftist propaganda outlet The Wire to discredit calls for investigating the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.Claim: Raksha Mantri @rajnathsingh admitted on @CNNnews18 that Chinese soldiers crossed Indian side of LACFact: The Minister was referring to differing perceptions of LAC & presence of Chinese troops It is being misinterpreted as if Chinese troops entered Indian side of LAC pic.twitter.com/Xews6Ba1bqAnother controversial expert cited by The Washington Post in its report was ‘journalist’ Ajai Shukla. He claimed, “(The defence establishment) exists to serve national and strategic interests, not political interests. But the BJP under Modi has seen critics as anti-Indian, the enemies of India itself.”Shukla has a history of peddling fake news (here and here) in the context of the India-China border dispute. He had also disseminated conspiracy theories post the 2019 Pulwama terror attack and was dubbed sexist by a prominent Italian journalist. Despite such dwindling credibility, The Washington Post roped him as an expert for its propaganda-laden piece on ‘Disinfo Lab.’India has been under tremendous pressure to choose sides, following the Russia-Ukraine war. The US state apparatus and the media on several occasions had even threatened India with sanctions for purchasing oil from Russia, only to receive befitting replies from External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Nevertheless, The Washington Post saw it as an opportunity to attack India’s neutral position in the ongoing crisis. “Coordinated social media accounts have been found to play a role, for instance, in spreading identical posts in support of Russia, an important supplier of weapons and energy to India…” it furthered the US State narrative.The leftist news outlet targeted the ‘Disinfo Lab’ for exposing the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and its biased reporting on India, which is often used to cast aspersions on Indian democracy.In February this year, OpIndia reported in detail about the ties of former USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava to far-left billionaire George Soros. We also exposed how the controversial body has relied on the dubious ‘Tek Fog’ story to make insinuations about India.Throughout its article, The Washington Post desperately tried to whitewash both anti-Hindu and anti-India activists and paint them as ‘victims’ of the social media exposé by ‘Disinfo Lab.’ One such activist mentioned by the leftist media outlet happens to be Pieter Friedrich, who has ties to Khalistani terrorist Bhajan Bhinder.“The organization released a dossier nearly 100 pages long alleging that Pieter Friedrich, a California-based activist and journalist who has written magazine articles and given public speeches critical of the BJP and affiliated Hindu-nationalist groups, had ties to the Sikh separatist movement and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency. The Disinfo Lab burrowed into California state records to uncover Friedrich’s employment history, published his parents’ names and plotted detailed graphs about his social media activity,” it claimed.1) The days of people like Friedrich making threats against non-white people,especially because of the color of their skin, their religious affiliation, or their country of origin must remain behind us.In 2021, OpIndia reported how Pieter Friedrich evolved from a Christian zealot and a Gandhi basher to a ‘critic of Hindu fascism’ and a Khalistani asset. In June last year, he was slammed for allegedly giving death threats to a Hindu US Representative from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi.The Washington Post lamented that ‘Disinfo Lab’, which posted a plethora of evidence tying ‘activist’ Sunita Vishwanath to far-left billionaire George Soros and his Open Society Foundations (OSF), was used against Congress scion Rahul Gandhi.“The Disinfo Lab dug into her past and reported that a nonprofit she launched to help female Afghan refugees had received funding from Soros’s Open Society Foundations. Two months later, after Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi attended a meeting in Washington with Viswanath as part of a U.S. tour, Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP’s social media team, tweeted a photo of the meeting and shared a flowchart stamped with the Disinfo Lab logo illustrating Viswanath’s connections to Soros,” wrote the leftist media outlet.Sunita Vishwanath is the co-founder of an organisation named ‘Women for Afghan Women’, which is funded by OSF. She is also the co-founder of ‘Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr)’ and has tried to create hysteria and panic among Indian Muslims about the National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We are especially appalled by the most recent nightmare of the Kashmiri people, and the situation of 1.9 million people in India who are rendered stateless due to the imposition of the travesty called the National Register of Citizens”, Vishwanath said in 2019. In September 2021, she also participated in the Hinduphobic conference ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva.’ The Washington Post also roped in the policy director of Hindus for Human Rights (HfHr), Ria Chakraborty, to make a case for an organisation named ‘Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC).’➡️IAMC's terror angleIAMC has close ties with terror organizations like SIMI, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jamaat-e-Islami.Infact, Mohammad Siddiqi, the founder of SIMI, was once hosted as a guest at IAMC.Research credit – @DisinfoLab pic.twitter.com/iufbOJy9gsAccording to the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Indian Americal Muslim Council has links [pdf] with the banned Islamic terror outfit, Students’ Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).Besides, the Indian American Muslim Council has ties with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) through its founder Shaik Ubaid. The IAMC is a Jamat-e-Islami-backed lobbyist organisation claiming to be a rights advocacy group.It had been caught spreading fake news to further the Islamist cause in India. It had also been slapped with the UAPA in 2021.The Washington Post also made references to anti-Brahmin activist Thenmozhi Soundarajan and her organisation ‘Equality Labs’. Soundarajan had shot to fame in 2018 after the then Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey clicked pictures with a poster, designed by her, carrying the tagline ‘Smash Brahmanical Patriarchy.’In April 2022, tech giant Google cancelled a talk by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, owing to the fear that it might create ‘division and rancour’ in the workplace. Google spokesperson Shannon Newberry had said, “We also made the decision to not move forward with the proposed talk which — rather than bringing our community together and raising awareness — was creating division and rancour.”In November last year, she went on an unhinged tirade against Yoga. During the one-and-a-half-hour-long podcast, Soundararajan cast aspersions on the history of the ancient Indian Hindu practice and claimed that it was used by Brahmins to oppress the Dalit community. She also insinuated that Yoga had an in-built system of hierarchy, which supposedly made it vulnerable to abuse.What does it mean to address the structural violence at the heart of yoga? I break the silence on the religious abuse that is at the heart of yoga and how healing begins with debrahminizing and decolonizing. Check it on the latest #conspirituality pod https://t.co/7OadWRA1EP pic.twitter.com/gWgEWCwIv7The Washington Post also attempted to whitewash far-left billionaire George Soros and his nefarious anti-India agenda.The leftist media outlet wrote, “In February, Soros, a frequent critic of Modi, warned in a speech at the Munich Security Conference that the Indian leader was undemocratic and would lose his “stranglehold” over the Indian government. A day later, the Disinfo Lab posted a lengthy tweet thread alleging that Soros had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and manipulated “fake” U.S.-based advocacy groups to smear India. A spokesperson for Soros’s Open Society Foundations called the Disinfo Lab’s claims “entirely baseless” and said they were part of a “campaign by this site and others in India against advocates of human rights, democratic governance and the rule of law in the service of the political aims of the BJP and its allies.”“India has been fighting a ‘perception war’ on all fronts since the start of 2023. On February 16 this year, George Soros exploited the Adani-Hindenburg controversy and launched a scathing attack on the Indian government.He claimed, “Modi and business tycoon Adani are close allies. Their fate is intertwined…Adani Enterprises tried to raise funds in the stock market, but it failed. Adani is accused of stock manipulation and his stock collapsed like a house of cards.”Soros accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of crony capitalism. “Modi is silent on the subject, but he will have to answer questions from foreign investors and in parliament,” he added.The Hungarian-American billionaire also said that the ‘shakedown’ caused to the Indian markets due to the Hindenburg Research report will result in ‘much needed institutional reforms’ and ‘democratic revival’. George Soros and his vicious ecosystem of NGOs, activists and journalists had been trying to prove PM Modi as an ‘electoral autocrat’ who needed to be ousted for the ‘greater good’ of this country. And it has been a work in progress for a long time.The Hungarian-American billionaire has also tried to use international institutions, which are funded by him, including Freedom House and  V-Dem (Varieties of Democracy) Institute to tarnish the image of India at a global level.In January 2020, the American billionaire committed $1 billion to start a global university to “fight nationalists” and climate change, calling them twin challenges that threaten the survival of our civilisation.Throughout the article, The Washington Post resorted to insinuations, and source-based allegations to discredit ‘Disinfo Lab.’ However, it failed to provide any empirical evidence that could dispute any claims of the Indian OSINT handle.The leftist news outlet had not refuted the assertion by ‘Disinfo lab’ that its exposé had led to the shutting down of several sources of fake data. “In its response to The Post, the Disinfo Lab pointed to its record of forcing “activists” and “human rights fronts” to shut down by exposing them,” it noted.Ironically, one such source of fake data, DOTO (Data of Database of the Oppressed), was cited by WaPo tech ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma in an article in January 2023 to allege that ‘religious hatred’ is on the rise in India.Turned out DOTO was full of fabrication & outright imagination. We exposed their fabrication, after which they first tried revising their data and later deleted and disappeared.DOTO met its fate in October this year and is no more among us. (RIP!)(12/n) pic.twitter.com/y55TrdzNWS‘Disinfo Lab’ had earlier exposed the fabrications of DOTO, following which the latter first revised and then deleted the database. The OSINT handle also uncovered the lies of another dubious organisation called OFMI (Organization for Minorities of India), following which the latter shut shop permanently.But after our exposé they shut down OFMI, pulled down its website, deleted traces, and went into oblivion. Most of the activists associated with them have also removed all references to OFMI.(6/n) pic.twitter.com/uj0DRlnTkhThe leftist media outlet had reached out to prominent people in the hopes of deterring them from sharing informative posts by ‘Disinfo Lab’. The Washington Post ‘journalist’ Pranshu Verma messaged American political commentator Jack Posobiec on Friday (8th December) and claimed that the Indian OSINT handle is run by an Intelligence officer.“We are doing a story on a group called Disinformation Lab. Our reporting shows this group combines fact-based research with unsubstantiated claims to paint U.S. government figures, researchers, Indian American human-rights activists and international humanitarian groups as part of a conspiracy, purportedly led by global Islamic groups and the billionaire George Soros, to undermine India. Our analysis found you have retweeted this organisation’s content,” he claimed. Some guy claiming to be from the Washington Post, just sent me a long text message alleging that I retweeted a post from an Indian intel agency-run media outlet Here’s my response pic.twitter.com/hoQcJ4Gjv0He further added, “Do you know about the organization’s background? Our research has found Disinfo Lab is actually run by an Indian Intelligence Officer. Did you know that?“Pranshu Verma then sought a response from the American political commentator based on his unsubstantiated assertions. “Due to the sensitive nature of this story, the time for response is tight. Please provide a response by the end of day today, Friday, December 8th,” he emphasised.However, he did not anticipate a befitting reply from Jack Posobiec that would put ‘The Washington Post’ in the dock. ” So if it’s a intel agency run-media outlet that basically makes it the same as the Washington Post then?” the American political commentator wrote.Jack Posobiec told Verma that The Washington Post is a media outlet run by the United States Intelligence and by his ‘assertion’ would make it similar to ‘Disinfo Lab.’ As expected, the tech ‘journalist’ did not respond to the message.After the article was published, The Washington Post did not reproduce the actual response of Jack Posobiec. While resorting to shrewd dishonesty, it wrote,” Posobiec did not address whether he was familiar with the organisation’s background.“With the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind, The Washington Post is leaving no stone unturned to make insinuations about the Modi government and target individuals and accounts known for debunking anti-India propaganda.The development comes amidst growing concerns about ‘regime change’ operations in India and neighbouring Bangladesh. Just last month, The Washington Post published a misleading piece wherein it dubbed requests for action to X (formerly Twitter) against extemists by Indian government as ‘global standard for online censorship.’Earlier, it romanticised an Islamist named Raqib Hameed Naik in an article titled ‘Tracking rising religious hatred in India, from half a world away.’ A vicious fake news peddler, Raqib Hameed Naik is the founder of anti-Hindu disinformation outlet ‘Hindutva Watch.’He is also infamous for denying the Hindu genocide, perpetrated by radical Islamists in the Kashmir Valley, in the early 1990s. Naik had also mocked the Hindu ‘Shivling’ found inside the Gyanvapi mosque in Kashi.The Washington Post has also published a dubious report on India and its solar power systems. It has given editorial space to the likes of scam-accused ‘journalist’ Rana Ayyub to parrot the narrative of ‘Muslims are in danger in India.’None of these articles are random but serve a sinister agenda to create a narrative that paints the incumbent elected government as ‘anti-democracy’ and ‘anti-minority’.In the US, The Washington Post has attempted to distort public perceptions through its dissemination of the Russian disinformation hoax – A conspiracy theory that suggests that the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 US Presidential election was influenced by Russia.It had also suppressed the ‘Hunter Biden Laptop’ story and influenced the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election. With less than 6 months left for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, the Indian public must be wary of attempts by Western publications to peddle their sinister agendaWhether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Jammu and Kashmir: PDP suspends all political activities for next 7 days after SC upholds abrogation of Article 370,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/jammu-and-kashmir-pdp-suspends-all-political-activities-for-next-7-days-sc-upholds-abrogation-of-article-370/,"A five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on Monday unanimously upheld the validity of the Union government's 2019 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, while pointing out that Article 370 is a ""temporary provision.""The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended all of its political activities for the next seven days.The party said the decision has been taken to stand in solidarity with the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of the Supreme Court’s verdict on Article 370.A five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court on Monday unanimously upheld the validity of the Union government’s 2019 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, while pointing out that Article 370 is a “temporary provision.”“The party president, Mehbooba Mufti, was scheduled to address various worker conventions as part of her ongoing public outreach programme, and many such conventions were scheduled over the next few days. Many other political activities were also scheduled by the party. But to stand in solidarity with our people at this crucial juncture in the wake of the Supreme Court of India’s verdict on the issue of Article 370, we have decided to cancel all our political activities for the next seven days,” Syed Suhail Bukhari, PDP Chief Spokesperson, said in a statement.The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the Union Government’s decision to abrogate Article 370 of the constitution which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and said that every decision taken by the Centre on behalf of a State can’t be subject to a legal challenge.A five-judge Constitution bench comprising Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, and Surya Kant delivered the verdict.CJI Chandrachud reading out the judgement said that every decision taken by the Centre on behalf of a State under proclamation can’t be subject to a legal challenge and it will lead to the administration of the State to a standstill.Supreme Court said that it has held that Article 370 was a temporary provision. “The proclamation of Maharaja stated that the Constitution of India will supersede. With this, the para of Instrument of Accession ceases to exist…. Article 370 was an interim arrangement due to war conditions in the State. Textual reading also indicates that Article 370 is a temporary provision,” the Court said.The Court also noted that Article 370 was meant for the constitutional integration of Jammu and Kashmir with the Union and it was not for disintegration and the President can declare that Article 370 ceases to exist.“Concurrence of the State government was not required to apply all provisions of the Constitution using Article 370(1)(d). So, the President of India taking the concurrence of the Union government was not malafide,” the Court noted.The Supreme Court also directed the Election Commission to hold Jammu and Kashmir Assembly elections by September 30, 2024. The Supreme Court said given the Centre’s submission on the restoration of the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir, it directs that statehood shall be restored as soon as possible.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

"11 December, 2023 ","Mohit Pandey to be the chief priest of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya: While the leftist ecosystem is linking it with caste, here is why...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/mohit-pandey-caste-ram-mandir-leftist-ecosystem/,"Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. The process of selecting priests to perform prayers at the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya was recently completed. As part of the process, regular applications were invited from interested devotees, and around 3000 people participated. The interested parties had to undergo a rigorous selection process that included specific criteria for choosing the priests for the Ram Mandir. In this entire process, 200 applicants were interviewed, out of which 50 candidates were selected for the post of priests.Subsequently, the reports saying that Mohit Pandey had been selected as the chief priest went viral on social media. Reacting to these reports, certain social media users tried to cast aspersions and raise questions over the selection process for priests asking why only a Brahmin was selected for this post.Many predictable handles, fanning the casteist divide and playing SC, OBC cards, started linking his selection with Brahminism highlighting his name, Manoj Pandey. A Dalit portal named ‘The Mooknayak’ tweeted in Hindi, ” Mohit Pandey will become the priest of Ram temple! Is it forbidden for Dalits to become priests?” ""राम मंदिर के पुजारी बनेंगे मोहित पांडे!""– क्या दलितों का पुजारी बनना मना है? pic.twitter.com/aZRstoJcA0Dilip Mandal fumed and wrote, “This temple is being built by the Government of India as a trust. It is not anyone’s ancestral property. There should be an agitation if the reservation is not given in the temple management. Everyone will give Dakshina and only one caste will withdraw all the money, this will not work.” बहुत सही। वैसे भी ये मंदिर भारत सरकार का ट्रस्ट बना रहा है। किसी के बाप की संपत्ति नहीं है। मंदिर मैनेजमेंट में रिज़र्वेशन न दिया गया तो आंदोलन होना चाहिए। दक्षिणा सब देंगे और सिर्फ सारा पैसा एक जाति के लोग निकालेंगे, ये नहीं चलेगा। https://t.co/Rp2qUwV6BeAn X user named Suraj Yadav in a sarcastic tone claimed that Dalits, OBCs, and Tribals are not Hindus. He wrote, “If he is a Hindu then he is selected. Keep in mind that Dalits, backward people, and tribals are not Hindus. Shudras, Ati Shudras, and people outside the caste system have no place either in the trust or in the place of worship. And this is especially for those Yadavs who are supporters of Manuvad or Brahminism.”हिन्दू है तो चयनित हुआ। दलित, पिछड़े, आदिवासी हिन्दू नहीं हैं, यह ध्यान रहे। शूद्र, अति शूद्र, जाति प्रथा से बाहर लोगों को न तो ट्रस्ट में स्थान है और न ही पूजा स्थल में। और यह उन यादवों के लिए ख़ास तौर से जो मनुवाद या ब्राह्मणवाद के समर्थक हैं। #SC_ST_OBC #ईवीएम_हटाओ… pic.twitter.com/RadVOwhiK9However, the pertinent thing is that those who are casting aspersions, neither know about the selection process nor are they aware of the merit due to which Mohit Pandey was selected for the post of Chief Priest.For those unversed, the necessary condition to become a priest in the Ramlala temple was that the candidate should have studied Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit from a recognised Gurukul. Additionally, the candidate must have been initiated into the Ramanandiya tradition. In line with that, attention was paid to the knowledge of Vedas, rituals, and Vedic mantras during the interview process to select priests for the Ram Mandir. The upper limit for the candidates was fixed at 30 years.Furthermore, despite their selection as Priest and Chief Priest, the selected candidates will have to undergo a long training period, which would last for 6 months, before they start performing their duties. In this training phase, they will be imparted in-depth knowledge of Vedas, rituals, Vedic mantras, and Ramayana. Only after the training phase is over, the priests will be able to perform the worship of Ramlala.As per the selection criteria, it was necessary to be a scholar of the Ramnandiya tradition, as well as to have expertise in the knowledge of Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit. The fact that Mohit Pandey passed all the selection criteria based on merit and ability, just like other candidates who were also evaluated, means that allegations of casteism and religious favoritism don’t arise. Notably, Mohit Pandey studied for seven years at Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth, Ghaziabad. He obtained a Shastri (Bachelor) degree from Sri Venkateswara Vedic University, affiliated with Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams in Tirupati. In 2023, he earned a master’s degree in Samaveda. He is also a scholar of the Ramanandiya tradition and possesses expertise in Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Likewise, other selected priests include youth from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. All the selected priests belong to the Ramanandiya tradition and have expertise in the Vedas, Shastras, and Sanskrit.Speaking with The New Indian Express, Professor Rani Sadashiva Murthy, Vice-Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara Vedic University expressed happiness over the selection of Mohit Pandey to the post of Chief Priest of Shri Ram Lal Temple. Murthy said, “Many students from the University serve as priests and acharyas in various temples. A soft-spoken person, Pandey’s nature, focus and dedication to his studies have earned him the opportunity to serve Lord Ram in the esteemed Ayodhya Ram mandir.”Mohit Pandey’s journey, from Ghaziabad to Tirupati and now Ayodhya after being selected as the Chief Priest of Ram Lala, is a testament to his dedication and rigorous training. Institutions like Dudheshwar Ved Vidyapeeth and Sri Venkateswara Vedic University in Ghaziabad have played a crucial role in nurturing individuals with spiritual abilities, as evidenced by their selection process.In such a situation, those who are pointing fingers at his selection and linking it with castism are vitiating society by fanning the caste divide. While the ecosystem has been carrying out smear campaigns and cast aspersions, it is important to highlight that there are several temples in different states of India, there are not only Dalit or Women priests, prayers are performed by Dalit women priests in these temples.In a previous article, OpIndia highlighted temples in which women and Dalits have been performing the responsibility of priests.

"11 December, 2023 ",Key takeaways from Supreme Court’s verdict upholding the abrogation of Article 370,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/key-takeaways-from-supreme-courts-verdict-upholdingthe-abrogation-of-article-370/,"The SC ruled that the power under Article 370 1D can be used to apply one provision, more than one provision, an entire part of the Constitution or all the provisions of the Constitution that is the entire Constitution.The Supreme Court on Monday (11th December) upheld the abrogation of Article 370, which grants a special and separate Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 and Article 35A of the Indian Constitution gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir thereby giving it a separate identity than the rest of India.On 5th August 2019, the Modi government revoked Article 370 and 35A thereby enabling the full and final Constitutional integration of the region into India. The same was immediately challenged by Advocate Manohar Lal Sharma who filed a petition under Article 32.The five-judge Constitution bench comprising of Chief Justice DY Chandrachud, Justices SK Kaul, Sanjeev Khanna, BR Gavai and Surya Kant delivered a series of significant observations while upholding the abrogation of Article 370.There were three judgments authored by the Supreme Court including by the CJI, Justice Gavai and Justice Surya Kant. A concurring opinion was authored by Justice SK Kaul and Justice Sanjeev Khanna had concurred with both judgments.To the question of the power of the President under Article 356 to designate the executive and legislative powers of a state to the Union, the CJI listed a 6-point conclusion.Upholding this power, in the 6th and last point, the CJI stated that every decision taken by the Union on behalf of the state is not subject to challenge.“Opening up challenge to every decision would lead to chaos and uncertainty. It would in effect put the administration in the state at a standstill,” CJI Chandrachud read.The SC laid down the criteria to assess action under Article 356 after it is exercised or brought into effect.The criteria stated by the SC was in three points which read as follows:“a) The exercise of the power by the President under Article 356 must have a reasonable nexus to the object of the Proclamation.”b) The person challenging the exercise of power must prima facie establish that it is a malafide or extraneous exercise of power. After a prima facie case is made, the ownership to the Union to justify that the exercise of the power had a reasonable nexus for the object of the proclamation.c) The exercise of power by the President for everyday administration of the state is not ordinarily subject to judicial review.”This essentially means that the Supreme Court laid down criteria for challenging the implementation of Article 356 after it is invoked by the Union. And this requires for the objecting party to prove that the exercise of the power is malafide.Moreover, the Supreme Court refused to accept the petitioner’s argument that the Union Government cannot take action which has irresversible consequences when a proclamation under Article 356 is imposed.The SC also did not accept the petitioner’s argument that Parliament can assume only the lawmaking powers of the legislature of the state when the Proclamation under Article 356 is issued.The Court observed that while exercising the powers of the legislature of the state under relevant Articles, the Parliament and the President are not delayed or blocked by absence of competence.The SC held in clear words that the state of Jammu and Kashmir did not enjoy internal sovereignity when it joined the Union of India by signing the instrument of accession.The SC cited the instrument of accession signed by the then ruler of Kashmir Raja Hari Singh.The SC observed that according to paragraph 8 of the instrument of accession, “nothing in the instrument would affect the continuance of the sovereignity of the Maharaja in the over the state.”The SC then observed that on 25th November 1949 a proclamation was issued for Jammu and Kashmir by Yuvraj Karan Singh which declared that the Constitution of India would not only supercede all other constitutional provisions in the state but also abrogate them.The SC held that that with this proclamation, the paragraph 8 of the instrument of accession ceased to be of legal consequence.The bench held that the proclamation reflects full and final surrender of Jammu and Kashmir to its sovereign ruler, to India, to her people who are sovereign.Furthermore, the SC categorically stated that neither does the Constitutional setup nor any other factors indicate that J&K retained an element of sovereignity.In a significant observation, the SC stated that the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was only to further define the relationship between the Union of India and the state of J&K whereas, it observed, that the relationship itself was already defined by the instrument of accession, the proclamation of 1949 and “more importantly” by the Constitution of India.The SC pointed the absence of the reference to sovereignity in the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir.“In contrast, the Constitution of India emphasizes in the preamble that the people of India resolve to constitute themselves or to constitute India into a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic Republic,” the CJI read.The SC stated that Article 1 and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution make it evident that J&K is an integral part of India. The apex court also pointed out that the same is reiterated in Section 3 of the constitution of J&K which is unamendable.The SC also observed that the Preamble of the constitution of J&K; sections 3, 5 and 147 of the state constitution coupled with Article 1 of the Indian Constitution read with the First Schedule as well as Article 370 “indicate in no uncertain terms” that J&K is subordinate to the Indian Constitution first and only then to its own constitution.The SC also observed that the Constitution has provisions specific to the varying concerns of various states depending upon the degree of their concerns. These provisions, the SC observed, are specific to that state.To that effect, the SC noted that the powers and privileges of Jammu and Kashmir are not distinguishable from the powers and privileges that are enjoyed by other states.The SC said that in order to answer this question, the bench had to decide on two other issues. The first issue was whether Article 370 is temporary.The SC held that Article 370 is a temporary provision “on the reading of the historical context in which it was included”. The SC elaborated on the same as follows.SC held that the Article 370 was implemented to provide for an “interim arrangement until the constituent assembly of J&K was formed and to take a decision on the legislative competence of the union on matters other than the ones stipulated in the instrument of accession and ratify the Constitution”.The second reason for Article 370, the SC observed, as a temporary purpose and interim arrangement in view of the special circumstance because of the war-like conditions in the state.The SC observed that a textual reading of Article 370 indicates that it is a temporary provision.The second issue was the effect of the dissolution of the constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir on the scope of powers under clause 3 of Article 370.In a big blow to the petitioners, the SC upheld the powers of the President under Article 370 clause 3 to issue a notification declaring that Article 370 ceases to exist.Moreover, the SC ruled that the President of India very much has this power even after the dissolution of the constituent assembly of J&K.The reasons cited by the SC for the same were as follows. The SC stated that clause 3 of Article 370 encapsulates the process by which the states could ratify the Constitution of India.The Constitution of India was ratified by every ruler of every Indian state on recommendations of the constituent assembly.In states where the constituent was not yet formed, the ruler had to ratify the Constitution. Once the constituent assembly was formed in these states, they could call for modification to the Constitution required for the state.The SC ruled that the recommendation of the Constituent assembly was not binding on the President.Furthermore, the SC observed that constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir was formed for framing the Constitution for the state and was not intended to be a permanent body but one for a specific purpose.Hence, the SC observed, that the power conferred to Article 370 clause 3 was only for the period of transition when the constituent assembly of J&K was formed pending the drafting of the state constitution.The Supreme Court observed that holding that the power under Article 370 clause 3 cannot be exercised after the dissolution of the constituent assembly would lead to the freezing of the process of integration.The SC added that the power of the President notfying that Article 370 ceases to exist applies equally to all states including to J&K under the First Schedule of the Indian Constitution.“Article 370 1D and Article 370 (3) were introduced with the purpose of constitutional integration and not for disintegration. So the power under Article 370 1D and Article 370 clause 3, even when exercised to its fullest extent does not freeze the system of integration contemplated by art 370 but is rather intended to enhance constitutional integration between the Union of India and J&K,” the SC ruled.Lastly, the SC observed that the President determines whether special circumstanes which warranted Article 370 have ceased to exist and that “it is a policy decision which completely falls within the realm of the executive”.The SC clearly observed that the Court cannot sit and appeal over the decision of the President of India on whether the special circumstances that led to Article 370 have ceased to exist.“However, the decision is not beyond the scope of judicial review,” the SC observed adding that the exercise of executive power can be challenged on the grounds of malafide.A very significant observation made by the Supreme Court was that the Constitutional integration of J&K into the Union of India was a process ongoing for the past 70 years and not a sudden one.The SC observed that it was not that only Article 1 and Article 370 were applied to J&K and neither was the entire Constitution suddenly applied to J&K after 70 years.“The slew of Constitutional orders issued by the President under Article 370 1D applying various provisions of the Constitution and applying provisions of modification indicate that over the course of the last 70 years the Union and J&K have through a collaborative exercise Constitutionally integrated the state of J&K with the Union,” it observed.The SC thereby also upheld that the exercise of power by the President to issue CO 273 was valid. Constitutional Order (CO) 273 issued by the President essentially sealed the abrogation of Article of 370 in J&K.The SC held that all provisions of the Constitution can indeed be applied to J&K under Article 370 1D.The SC categorically ruled that the power under Article 370 1D can be used to apply one provision, more than one provision, an entire part of the Constitution or all the provisions of the Constitution that is the entire Constitution.“The provision does not make a distinction between one or all provisions of the Constitution. Non application of mind cannot be claimed merely because of CO 272 applies all provisions of the Constitution to J&K in one go,” the SC ruled.The SC held that the President seeking the concurrance of the Union Government instead of the state government to issue CO 272 is not invalid.The SC observed that the application of power by President under Article 370 1D is similar to the application of Article 370 clause 3 notifying that Article 370 shall cease to exist with the exception that the former can be reversed and the latter cannot.The SC ruled that consultation and collaboration between the Union and the state is necessary only where a application provision of the Indian Constitution would require amendment to the state constitution.This, the SC observed, is to ensure that the constitution of the J&K is not inconsistent to the Indian Constitution. The SC observed that the principle of consultation and collaboration by the Union with the state is not required to be followed.The SC further held that the exercise of power is malafide only if inteded to deceive. The SC ruled that the President securing the concurrance of the Union of India on behalf of the state government is not malafide.The Supreme Court cited the observations of the 5-Judge SC bench in Babulal Parate case. Th had held that the views held by the state legislature under the proviso to Article 3 are not binding on the Parliament.The SC held that the Parliament’s exercise of power under the first proviso of Article 3 is valid and not malafide, the SC held.The SC mentioned the submission of the Solicitor General that the statehood of J&K will be restored and that the status of Union Territory is only temporary.The SC also mentioned that the SG submitted that the status of Ladakh as a UT will not be affected by the restoration of the statehood of J&K.In view of the submission, the SC held that it is not necessary to determine whether the reorganisation of J&K into two Union Territories of Ladakh and J&K is permissible under Article 3.The SC also ruled that elections to J&K cannot be put on hold until statehood is restored and directed that the Election Commision of India take steps to conduct elections in J&K on 30th September 2024.The SC directed that the restoration of statehood should be done as early as possible.Justice SK Kaul’s epilogue after his judgement was a key highlight of the judgment by the Supreme Court. A Kashmiri Pandit himself, Justice Kaul echoed the struggles of the community.He called on the “need to achieve collective understanding of the human rights violations perpetuated both by state and non-state actors of the people of this region”. Justice SK Kaul recommended the setting up of a Truth and Reconciliation Committee (TRC) to investigate the violation of human rights violation both by state and non-state actors perpetrated in Jammu and Kashmir at least since 1980s and recommend measures for reconciliation.“The commission should be set up expeditiously before memory escapes. The exercise should be time bound,” he said. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"11 December, 2023 ",“Inko nahi samjha sakta”: Amit Shah takes a dig at Congress over stance on SC verdict concerning Article 370,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/amit-shah-takes-dig-at-congress-over-stance-on-sc-verdict-concerning-article-370/,"Shah said Congress should consider changing its position. ""…or your numbers will go down further. There will be a contest in 2024 (Lok Sabha polls), Modiji will become PM for the third time,"" Shah said.Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday took a dig at Congress over its stance of disagreeing with the Supreme Court judgement over how Article 370 was abrogated from Jammu and Kashmir and said the opposition party will continue to lose elections with such a stand.Replying to the debate in the Rajya Sabha on the two bills relating to Jammu and Kashmir, Amit Shah said it was an important day as the bills will be passed by Parliament on a day the Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370.The Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2023 were passed by Lok Sabha last week.Targeting the Congress, Amit Shah said the opposition party has said it does not agree with how Article 370 has been abrogated.He said due procedure and rules were followed while abrogating Article 370 in August 2019 and now the Supreme Court has also given its verdict.“Main inko nahi samjha sakta, meri maryada hai (I cannot them make them understand, I have a limit),” he said.The Home Minister said Article 370 led to separatism, which nurtured terrorism.He said Congress should consider changing its position. “…or your numbers will go down further. There will be a contest in 2024 (Lok Sabha polls), Modiji will become PM for the third time,” Shah said.Congress on Monday said that the judgement of the Supreme Court in the cases concerning the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution has decided many issues but has left open some issues that are also vitally important.“Prima facie, we respectfully disagree with the judgement on how Art. 370 was abrogated. We reiterate the Congress Working Committee resolution dated August 6, 2019, that Art. 370 deserved to be honoured until it was amended strictly by the Constitution of India,” Congress leader P Chidambaram said addressing a joint press conference.“We are also disappointed that the Supreme Court did not decide the question of dismembering the State and reducing its status to two Union Territories. That question has been reserved for adjudication in a suitable case in the future,” he said.“The Indian National Congress has always demanded the restoration of full statehood for what has become the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. We welcome the Supreme Court’s verdict in this regard. Full statehood must be restored immediately. The aspirations of the people of Ladakh must also be fulfilled,” he added.Chidambaram said the party welcomes the Supreme Court’s direction to hold assembly elections. “However, we believe that the elections should be held immediately and there is no reason to wait until September 2024. When elections are held, the people of Jammu & Kashmir will have an opportunity to express their views on the crucial questions that were debated in the Hon’ble Supreme Court — an opportunity that has been denied to them so far,” Chidambaram added.The Congress leader said the Supreme Court judgement has 476 pages and the party will study it carefully.

The teacher was subsequently sacked. A case of harassment of a student from a school in the Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh has come to the fore, after which the members of Hindu organizations launched demonstrations in front of the school and demanded strict action against all the authorities at the school. The student was harassed at the school for greeting his teacher, Mohammed Adnan, ‘Ram Ram’. The principal of the school is also said to have abused the student and his family members.The school administration has, however, issued a written apology in this matter. The dispute pertains to Saima Mansoor Public School, which is run by Aligarh’s Noorul Uloom Education Society. The incident is reported to have taken place on Friday (8th December 2023).This case relates to the Hathras district’s Chandpa police station area. A video of a student’s brother captured at the school gate went viral on social media on 8th December 2023. A man recognizing himself as Gajendra Singh Sisodia at the Saima Mansoor Public School gate said that his brother was harassed for greeting his teacher by saying “Ram-Ram.” The teacher Mohammed Adnan did not respond, and he left after the class was over. However, he is said to have complained to Principal Salman Kidwai about the matter. #हाथरस: साईमा मंसूर पब्लिक स्कूल में बच्चों के राम-राम कहने पर कॉलेज प्रबंधन ने लगाई रोकराम-राम बोलने पर बच्चों को जमकर हड़काया, अभिभावक शिकायत करने गए तो उन्हें स्कूल से धक्के मार कर भगाया, हिंदू लड़कियों को जबरन हिजाब पहनने का दबाब बनाने का भी प्रबंधन पर आरोप, अभिभावकों ने… pic.twitter.com/p7vxWVh8QlAccording to Gajendra Sisodia, Principal Salman Kidwai visited the class following the teacher Mohammad Adnan’s complaint.

Greet Salaam, Namaste, whatever you want but no one will say, Ram Ram,” Kidwai said according to Sisodia. The student who has been abused and harassed at the school studies in 11th class and his family was pushed out after they went to complain about the matter to the authorities. Anger among the Hathras Hindu organizations increased on Friday (8th December) after the video of the incident went viral.

Reserved seats for scheduled tribes and representation for Kashmiri migrant communities were introduced alongside the delimitation process.Furthermore, following the abrogation of Article 370, elections in Jammu and Kashmir opened for those who settled in the region and were previously deemed as “outsiders”. This inclusive move allowed West Pakistan refugees residing in the UT for 70 years to participate actively in the local elections.The socio-political landscape of the region has changed extensively over the past four years. Almost zero incidents of stone pelting, paced-up infrastructure, and introduction of government schemes in the region are some of the examples of changes brought to J&K following the abrogation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ","FT comes to Mahua Moitra’s rescue, plays the ‘woman’ victim card to gloss over bribery charges and misuse of parliamentary privilege",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ft-comes-to-mahua-moitras-rescue-plays-woman-victim-card-after-ls-expulsion/,"On 8th December, Lok Sabha expelled Trinamool Congress’s MP Mahua Moitra based on the recommendations of the Ethics Committee in a cash-for-query case. Moitra was expelled hours after the Ethics Committee report was tabled in Lok Sabha. Following her expulsion, the left ecosystem, including the Western media, came to her rescue. Financial Times published a report titled “Indian parliament expels firebrand female critic of Modi and Adani”, where Moitra was painted as a female victim. The report’s title projected a narrative that she was expelled for being a critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and businessman Gautam Adani.FT projected Moitra as a prominent female opposition MP known for her “criticism of PM Modi and Adani conglomerate”. The report further claimed that she was expelled for “immoral and indecent” conduct, which was, according to Moitra, trumped-up allegations. The report had a vague mention of the actual allegations, which was asking questions in the Parliament on behalf of Dubai-based Indian businessman Darshan Hiranandani in exchange for gifts.The report further mentioned that the matter came to the fore out of the “bitter custody battle” between pet rottweiler Henry and her ex-partner, Jai Anant Dehadrai. However, FT completely ignored the fact that Moitra not only shared her Lok Sabha credential with unauthorised personnel but also allegedly received benefits in the form of expensive gifts, cash and renovation of her house.On 9th November, the Ethics Committee’s draft report accused Moitra of “unethical conduct”. The report stated that she shared her login credentials with unauthorised individuals. The draft revealed that Moitra made multiple trips to UAE, and her account was logged in 47 times from Dubai. The Ethics committee sought a report on IP addresses and emphasised the legal consequences of the MP’s action. The committee recommended her expulsion from the Lok Sabha. In the parts of the conversation that OpIndia accessed, Moitra accepted twice that she had shared credentials with Darshan Hiranandani.Hiranandani, in his affidavit, accepted paying for most of the questions asked by Moitra in the Lok Sabha in the form of cash and gifts. He also acknowledged that the TMC MP provided him with her Parliamentary login credentials, which he used to ask questions from the central government on her behalf. Hiranandani further revealed that the TMC MP was “over-ambitious”, and in her desperation to shoot to fame, she took the advice of her few friends who told her that the only way to be recognised at a national level is to target PM Modi and since the PM had an impeccable reputation, the only tenable way to do that was to malign Gautam Adani.On 14th October, the Indian political scene experienced a major tremor as BJP MP Nishkant Dubey wrote to the ethics committee seeking an inquiry against TMC MP Mahua Moitra in the ‘Cash for Query’ matter. He based his complaint on the letter written by Supreme Court lawyer Jai Anant Dehadrai, who alleged that most of the questions asked by the TMC MP in Lok Sabha directly or indirectly benefit businessman Darshan Hiranandani. Dehadrai also accused Moitra of “kidnapping” his pet dog Henry, adding another layer of complications to Mahuagate.Moitra filed a case against Dubey and Dehadrai but never denied accepting gifts. Interestingly, she has also been accused of sharing her Lok Sabha credentials with Hiranandani so he can post questions independently. Hiranandani has reportedly turned approver in the case and submitted an affidavit suggesting the allegations against Moitra are true. Dehadrai and Dubey were called to submit evidence of Moitra’s alleged wrongdoings in front of the ethics committee on 26th October. When the Ethics Committee initially called Moitra, she refused, claimed to have prior engagements and sought another date. She got another date for the hearing, and on the day of the hearing, she played the victim card while coming out, claiming she faced “cheerharan” like Draupadi from Mahabharat. Henry was later returned to Dehadrai.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

"11 December, 2023 ","‘Dhiraj Sahu is from Jharkhand, but BJD govt in Odisha is running his liquor empire’, says BJP: How the I-T raids may impact Odisha...",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/dhiraj-sahu-jharkhand-bjd-govt-odisha-is-running-his-liquor-empire-says-bjp-i-t-raids-cash/,"Allegations have been raised that the Naveen Patnaik government's liquor policy has been designed to favor the manufacturers of country liquor, because the money from these businesses funds the ruling party. The BJP has said that Dhiraj Sahu's liquor empire has been funding the election campaigns of BJD in several districts. The Income Tax raids on the liquor empire of Jharkhand MP Dhiraj Sahu have entered the 6th day today. The biggest cash haul was found in Odisha’s Balangir, in a Bhatti (liquor manufacturing unit) in Balangir, Odisha. Cash was loaded in 176 bags and brought to the main SBI branch in the city where counting was going on for 5 days. Even after the initial haul, raids are still ongoing on several office and factory premises of Baldev Sahu and Sons Ltd, and on the residences of the company’s owners. Balangir is a town in the western part of Odisha. Most people in India had probably never heard of its name until news flashed that over 300 crores in cash have been seized from a liquor manufacturing unit in this town. Those viral videos of almirahs full of currency notes are from the office of Baldev Sahu and Sons Ltd located in Sudpada, Balangir. Income Tax dept raids on liquor manufacturing unit at Sudapada in #Bolangir district continue for sixth day #Odisha pic.twitter.com/HZSZxN7eLOThe viral videos of people busy counting currency seen on social media and TV news are not from Jharkhand but from Balangir. While Congress MP Dhiraj Sahu is from Jharkhand, and the raids include his Lohardaga and Ranchi properties, it is notable here that most of the cash has been seized not from Jharkhand, but from towns in Western Odisha like Balangir, Sambalpur, and Titilagarh.One of the companies raided by the I-T department was Boudh Distilleries Pvt Ltd. Balangir’s Baldev Sahu and Sons Pvt Ltd was in a partnership with BDPL. As per reports, S Shiw Ganga and Company, BDPL, Baldev Sahu Infra Private Limited, Kwality Bottlers Private Limited (IMFL Botting), Kishore Prasad Vijay Prasad Beverages Private Limited, and other such companies are all linked with Dhiraj Sahu, who hails from Lohardaga in Jharkhand. Boudh is a tribal-dominated district in central Odisha. Dhiraj Sahu’s son Ritesh Sahu is the MD of Boudh Distilleries Pvt Ltd, while his elder brother Uday Shankar Prasad is the chairman. The Congress MP from Jharkhand has a multi-billion liquor empire spread across several districts of Odisha. Now that the shocking amount of cash seized has jolted the I-T officials and the public in general to the enormity of the liquor empire, there are questions rising on Odisha’s ruling party. This question is slowly heating up Odisha politics as visuals of unprecedented amounts of cash, almirahs full of currency notes and bank branches running out of cash-counting machines dominate the news space. BJP MP from Sundargarh, Kusum Tete, has been openly saying that the liquor empire spread across Odisha has links to local BJD leaders. She stated that she has raised the issue several times in the assembly, but the BJD government has not paid heed to her concerns. Naming BJD’s former MLA Jogesh Singh, Kusum Tete stated that he has links to Dhiraj Sahu’s liquor empire. Tete stated that the liquor manufacturing units were earlier registered in the name of Singh’s mother. Tete stated that she has raised the issue several times in the assembly but the government took no action.I-T raids in #Sundargarh | MLA Kusum Tete brings serious allegations against former legislator Jogesh Singh; says, ""The liquor manufacturing unit was registered in the name of Singh's mother.

As of 10th December, the SBI branch in Balangir declared that all the 176 bags of cash brought from the premises of Baldev Sahu and Sons were counted. This counting took 5 days, and involved dozens of bank staff, and counting machines. Reports in Odisha have stated that the total amount of cash seized from Odisha is over 400 crores and nearly 60 kgs of gold. 2 more liquor traders, reportedly the relatives of Dhiraj Sahu, named Deepak Sahu and Sanjay Sahu, were raided in Titilagarh, a town in Balangir district. I-T seized 11 crores of cash from the premises of the Sahu brothers. Raids at the Sambalpur unit of the company found 37.5 crores. The political implications of the case were hinted at by Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in Odisha yesterday. Without taking names, he stated that the money has been looted from the poor people from Odisha and Modi government will ensure that the powerful people linked with the ‘family business’ of the Congress leader (Dhiraj Sahu), will have to answer before the public of Odisha. #ଯିଏ_ଓଡି଼ଆଙ୍କ_ଟଙ୍କା_ଲୁଟିଛି_ସେ_ଜେଲ_ଯିବକଳାଟଙ୍କାକୁ ନେଇ ପୁଣି ବର୍ଷିଲେ କେନ୍ଦ୍ରମନ୍ତ୍ରୀ ଧର୍ମେନ୍ଦ୍ର ପ୍ରଧାନ । କାହା ନାଁ ନନେଇ କହିଲେ, ଓଡିଶାବାସୀଙ୍କ ଟଙ୍କାକୁ ଯିଏ ଲୁଟିଛି ତାକୁ ଜେଲ ପଠାଯିବ । #DharmendraPradhan #Reaction #ITRaid #KanakNews pic.twitter.com/UA4ZOt927xThe BJP held a press conference in Bhubaneswar yesterday. State spokesperson Lekhashree Samantsinghar took names of senior leaders and ministers in the BJD government and stated that the Jharkhand MP Dhiraj Sahu is just the owner of the companies, but his liquor empire in Odisha was being ‘managed’ by the ruling BJD. “Jharkhand Congress MP is only the owner of the company. BJD govt was managing it in Odisha. What was the Vigilance, Crime Branch, Excise, EOW doing when the company was amassing such wealth, and how the state govt had no information about it? This liquor business is the source of money for BJD during elections”, she stated.I-T raids in #Odisha | BJP alleges involvement of BJD leaders and Odisha govtTaking the names of Minister Tukuni Sahu, Niranjan Pujari, Pradip Amat and Jogesh Singh, BJP's Lekhashree Samantsinghar says, ""Jharkhand Congress MP is only the owner of the company. BJD govt was… pic.twitter.com/tujY8BCQ4OMeanwhile, local news channels in Odisha are abuzz with political whispers and concerns from the public. Claiming that the liquor empire money was a major source of political funding in the state, some have alleged that the Odisha government has not issued fresh tenders for liquor outlets in the last 25 years. Some select traders have been getting renewed licenses every year. Allegations have been raised that the Naveen Patnaik government’s liquor policy has been designed to favor the manufacturers of country liquor, because the money from these businesses funds the ruling party. The names of several BJD leaders are being cited in links with the Sahu brothers. The names of Ministers Tukuni Sahu (Titilagarh), Niranjan Pujari (Sonepur), Rajendra Dholakia (Nuapada) and Pradip Amat (Boudh) are being cited by BJP and many local news outlets as the alleged benefactors of the massive liquor trade and country liquor manufacturing units flourishing across the state. Odia channel Argus News reported that the liquor traders were regularly paying the BJD leaders and were supplying vehicles, cash, and liquor during the election campaigns of these leaders. The BJP, meanwhile, has stated that it will organize protests in every subdivision of the state and will demand answers from the BJD leaders. The I-T raids have reportedly also seized a ‘red diary’ from the premises of liquor traders that mentions the names of many government officials, politicians and powerful individuals who were in the payrolls of the liquor empire. At the national level, PM Modi’s tweet stating that every paisa looted from the people will be accounted for had displayed the government’s intention that the political angles of the liquor trade are to be uncovered. The BJP has already started protests against the Congress. There are reports that the ED might start investigations into the case considering the massive amount of money and political links involved.

"11 December, 2023 ","OpIndia Exclusive: Niyaz, Saddam, Arbaaz and 13 others booked for assaulting Gorakshaks with swords and iron rods in Ahmednagar",https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/ahmednagar-16-booked-for-assaulting-gorakshaks-with-swords-and-iron-rods/,"The incident took place on 6th December 2023 when some of the local Hindus and Gorakshaks confronted smugglers who were illegally transporting the bovines from Loni market to Mamadpur village for illegal slaughter.On 7th December, Maharashtra Police booked 16 persons for launching a brutal attack on Gorakshaks and threatening them with death in the Loni region of Ahmednagar district. The accused attacked local Hindus after the latter called the police and exposed the accused who were caught slaughtering bovines in the Mamdapur village near Loni. The accused attacked the Hindu Gorakshaks using swords and iron rods, causing severe injuries to them. The victims were immediately shifted to the local hospital and are undergoing treatment. The accused persons have been identified as Niyaz Qureshi, Saddam Qureshi, Arbaaz Qureshi, Sajim Qureshi, Saajid Qureshi, Wasim Qureshi, Samir Qureshi, Ajim Shah, Shakir Shah, Jatif Qureshi, Munir Qureshi, Imran Abdul Haq Sheikh, Ansar Ibrahim Sheikh, Najim Fakir Mohammed Sheikh, Muddasar Yasim Sheikh and Hussain Fakir Mohammed Sheikh. These persons have been booked under sections 307 (punishment for attempt to murder), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (causing hurt using dangerous weapons), 427 (mischief), 506 (criminal intimidation), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, sections 4 and 25 of the Arms Act and 37(1) and 135 of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951. As per the FIR copy obtained by OpIndia, the incident is said to have happened on 6th December 2023 at around noon when some of the local Hindus and Gorakshaks learned that some smugglers were illegally transporting the bovines from Loni market to Mamadpur village for illegal slaughter. The Gorakshaks immediately informed the local police who reached the spot. The Hindu gorakshaks identified as Appa Naikwade, Ishwar Tilekar, Sairaj Bendre, and others then assisted the Police and showed them the Mamdpur location where the cows were being illegally slaughtered. “I along with Ishwar, Sairaj went with the police in our private vehicle to Mamadpur spot to show the police the location of illegal cow slaughter. The Police saw some of the Bovines tied to a rope for illegal slaughter. However, the accused persons saw us and they launched a brutal attack on us,” Appa Naikwade, one of the victims said. As per the complaint, the 16 identified accused and 10-12 other unidentified accused arrived at the spot with sharp weapons and threatened the gorakshaks as they attempted to release the bovines with the help of the police. The bones and other body parts of the already slaughtered bovines could be spotted at the location. The accused saw the gorakshaks and launched a brutal attack. The 16 identified accused used swords, iron rods, and sticks to assault the gorakshaks resulting in severe injuries. The accused also threatened the gorakshaks saying, “We won’t leave you this time, kill them all.” The Police then tried to settle the matter and rescued the gorakshaks to a nearby farm. However, the victims had attained severe injuries by then. One of the victims identified as Sairaj has been admitted to the hospital and has attained severe injuries. OpIndia tried to contact the victim but the latter could not speak. He has been advised to take rest by the doctors. OpIndia also tried to contact the Loni Police station where the complaint has been filed, but the calls remained unestablished. Further probe is underway. Cow protection has been painted as a ‘communal’ issue where Gorakshaks are depicted as rogue groups that attack ‘innocent’ Muslims transporting cows to slaughterhouses. Cattle are a source of livelihood for millions in rural India and are loved as their family members. Cows, especially, are also considered holy by Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs alike, and slaughtering them is considered to be a sin.The government has imposed a ban on cow slaughter as per the Animal Welfare Act. Despite this, numerous cows, bullocks, cattle, and other animals are smuggled across Telangana state at night in both large and small vehicles from the state of Maharashtra.Earlier on 20th November, a similar incident was reported from the Satara district of Maharashtra. A 29-year-old Gorakshak identified as Wagheshwar Adake was brutally assaulted by a group of ‘smugglers’ who were illegally transporting cattle for slaughter from the Barad Marketyard area of Phaltan in Maharashtra’s Satara district. The victim was attacked by a sharp knife after he stopped the truck carrying around 35-40 buffaloes illegally on the Phaltan-Pandharpur road.On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In his judgment, CJI Chandrachud held that Jammu and Kashmir does not hold any internal sovereignty after accession to the Union of India. Furthermore, CJI said that Article 370 was a temporary provision, and it was introduced to serve a transitional purpose to serve an interim process. It was introduced due to the war-like conditions in the state. CJI added that the textual reading showed it was a temporary provision, and thus it was placed in part 21 of the constitution.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

"11 December, 2023 ",Chadar of sanitised history over ugly side of ‘Sufi saints’: I got death threats by Islamists for talking about historical facts – so let...,https://www.opindia.com/2023/12/nupur-j-sharma-moinuddin-chisti-sufi-saints-demand-arrest-threats-statement/,"Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.On the 2nd of December, I interviewed the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. He is the son of one of the founders of Hamas Sheikh Hassan Yousef. The interview was necessitated after a Hindu boy from Kashmir started getting Sar Tan Se Juda threats after he shared an old interview snippet of Yousef, where he was talking about Islam. After the boy from NIT Srinagar was threatened by the Islamist mob, Yousef took to his X page and posted that the Jihadis should go after him and leave the boy alone. In his interview with me, he categorically said that if anyone touched the Hindu boy, the repercussions would be dire. Beyond the NIT Srinagar case, Yousef and I also spoke at length about Islam, Islamism and the fate of the rest of the world in the face of a cult that was perpetually offended and believed that the use of violence to express that offence was their divine right – nay – duty. During the discussion, Yousef mentioned how Sufism was one of the most peaceful, spiritual branches of Islam. A Hindu, however, knows that this statement rings hollow. I told Yousef that as a Hindu, I find it difficult to make sense of that perception since Hindus have been raped and murdered by Sufis. As an example of the Sufi onslaught against Hindus, I cited the example of Moinuddin Chisti, how cows were slaughtered and Hindu Temples desecrated and also alluded to the Ajmer Dargah rape scandal where the self-proclaimed descendants of Moinuddin Chisti and the custodians of his legacy raped hundreds of Hindu girls and blackmailed them – a sordid saga from 1992. It is pertinent to mention here that I don’t blame Mosab Hassan Yousef for the views he holds on Sufism. Many Hindus themselves believe that Sufism is peaceful and spiritual. In fact, a chunk of the business that the Amer Dargah gets is from Hindus who visit the shrine – not Muslims. Even though it was some of the Chistis associated with the Ajmer Dargah who had issued death threats to Nupur Sharma and called for her beheading. Khadim Gauhar Chishti of Ajmer Dargah had links to Kanhaiya Lal’s murder. Khadim of Ajmer Dargah named Gauhar Chishti had met one of the killers of the Hindu tailor. Ajmer Dargah Khadim Salman Chishti threatened to kill Nupur Sharma. The history-sheeter with over 13 cases filed against him, including murder and attempt to murder, claimed that he would hand over his house to anyone who brings Sharma’s head. Sarwar Chishti of the Anjuman Committee of the Ajmer dargah had said “The situation in the country right now, is such that people are committing blasphemy. They are doing mischief in the glory of the Prophet, in the glory of the Khwaja. We will not tolerate this at all. We will launch such a massive agitation that the whole Hindustan will shake.” Sarwar Chishti had called himself a member of the PFI. In 2020, he defended PFI saying the organisation was ”saving India’s constitution”. He had also called for a boycott of Hindus. Syed Aadil Chishti – son of Sarwar Chishti – mocked Hindu deities after the Nupur Sharma incident.Nothing I said was historically inaccurate and I will come to that. Days after the interview, a clip where I mentioned Moinuddin Chisti was shared on social media by Islamists, claiming that I had insulted the Sufi ‘saint’ and I should be arrested. What started with the hashtag #ArrestNupurJSharma soon turned into a free-for-all – I got death threats, rape threats and the usual ‘Sar Tan se Juda’ threats. My reaction was the chuckle at the irony of it all. After all, my statement came just as it was being claimed that Sufis are peaceful and spiritual – a model for all Muslims to follow. Here is a sneak peak into their spiritual moorings: While the peaceful Sufis demanded for my head and arrest, I held my peace for 3 days – not because I was scared but because I believed that their outrage would die down. It did not. I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant. I believe the truth – historical facts – can’t be suppressed simply because some people are offended by it. As an American conservative says, ‘facts don’t care about your feelings’. I have repeated over and over again the purpose of my professional existence – I picked up my pen because ‘they’ sold theirs. I would not do justice to my role or my readers if I don’t stand by the truth. If I cower today. And therefore, I feel it necessary to substantiate my statement with historical evidence. With regards to Sufism, there is a broad perception that it is a peaceful, spiritual sect of Islam. However, there are certain myths attached to this notion that need honest conversation. Historically, several genocides against Hindus and crimes against their faith/places of worship have been led by Sufis or have been conducted at the behest of Sufis. It is a matter of historical record that eighteenth-century Sufi preacher Shah Waliullah’s letters to Islamic rulers and nobles show that he was very keen on rejuvenating Islamic supremacy in Delhi, which had started to loosen its grip over the sub-continent after Aurangzeb’s death. According to the book by Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, Shah Waliullah wrote a letter to Ahmad Shah Abdali, the invader from Afghanistan, inviting him to India to establish Islamic supremacy by suppressing Hindus.From the invite to Ahmad Shah Abdali to the mastermind of the Noakhali genocide belonging to a Sufi sect – Shah Syed Gholam Sarwar Husseini, the hereditary pir of Dayra Sharif, a Sufi shrine in Noakhali, Sufism has a chequered history – one which is well documented – a history of genocide, enslavement, forced conversion and establishment of the supremacy of Islam. Those Sufis who refused to adhere to Orthodox Islam were persecuted – the sects we talk about today were not. MA Khan writes that Sufi leaders had poured into India along with the Turkic invaders and most of them, Nizamuddin Aulia, Aamir Khasrau, Nasiruddin Chiragh, Moinuddin Chishti and Jalaluddin etc, were all known for holding the Ulemas, orthodox Islamic scholars in high esteem. Khan further writes that though Nizamuddin Aulia and Moinuddin Chishti were among the most unorthodox when it came to music and dance, in the matters of Islam and Islamic supremacy, they held the words of the Ulema as sacrosanct. “What the Ulema seeks to achieve through speech, the Sufis achieve by behaviour,” Nizamuddin Aulia had said.The great Sufi saint Nasiruddin Chiragh had reportedly banned all practices that were deviant from the Sharia. Khan quotes Prof KA Nizami to describe what the Sufi leader Ghazzali had told in terms of Jihad, the Islamic religious war against Kafirs. Ghazzali had written that his followers must go on Jihad at least once a year and should bring down the fortresses of non-Muslims, they should cut down their throats drown them and burn their holy books. Jihadists may take whatever booty they desire. Toeing the orthodox line, Nizamuddin Aulia had condemned the Hindus of India to the ‘fires of hell’. He had also written that even if non-Muslims embrace Islam, the faith will not benefit them, because they had been unbelievers. He had added, “He, (Allah) has created paradise and hell for the believers and the infidels respectively to repay the wicked they (infidels) have done.” Now, coming to the specific comments in question about Moinuddin Chisti – one made during an interview with the Son of Hamas – Mosab Hassan Yousef. It is necessary to place on record that in the full video interview uploaded on YouTube, the mention of Moinuddin Chisti had long been redacted. Let me explain why. When I asked the question about Sufism and Hindus, I intended to talk about the campaign of certain Sufis against Hindus – which has been documented throughout history – even as recently as 1992. In the video description, I have explained that when I spoke of rape, I was referring to the Ajmer Dargah Rape scandal where hundreds of Hindu girls were raped with the active connivance and participation of the Khadims of Ajmer Dargah – the Chistis – who claim to be the descendants of Moinuddin Chisti. Farooq Chisti was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007, but in 2013, the Rajasthan High Court deemed he had served ‘enough’ time and therefore, released him. The Ajmer Dargah still associates itself with him and his local clout has remained intact. Nafis Chist was absconding until 2003, before being caught by the Delhi Police while trying to escape, wearing a burqa. He is currently out on bail and respected in a similar way in Ajmer. These are facts. In the second part of the question, I spoke about cows being slaughtered and thrown into Hindu temples. I also spoke about the desecration of Hindu temples and the Jihad waged by Moinuddin Chisti – this assertion is again documented in history. Here is an excerpt from the book “Islamic Jihad” by MA Khan. Khan writes further that every day, Khwaja’s followers used to bring a cow and they used to slaughter it near a prominent temple where the local Raja and Hindus used to pray, cook kebabs from the cow’s meat to eat, just to show contempt towards the local Hindus. Chishti had come to India to fight Jihad on the side of the Sultan Muhammad Ghauri against the Hindu King Prithviraj Chauhan. Chishti had credited himself for Prithviraj’s capture, writing, “We have seized Pithaura (Prithviraj) and handed him to the army of Islam.” In addition, this is what a previous version of the website of Ajmer Dargah itself said and I quote, “When he had settled down in Ajmer, the Khawaja Sahib had a special reminder about his marriage through a ‘Basharat’ (prophetic dream) from the Holy prophet sometime in 590 AH or 1193 AD. The Prophet said, “O Moinuddin, You are a great preceptor of our religion. You should not depart from our ‘sunnah’ (meaning marriage which is incumbent upon every Muslim under the laws of Shariat). Coincidentally that very night Malik-a-Khitab devotee of Hazrat Khawaja Sahib, had captured a Raja’s daughter in an encounter who embraced Islam and Khawaja sahib, in response to the above reminder, married her giving her the Islamic name of Bibi Ummutulla..” Here is an archive link to the page: https://web.archive.org/web/20180319103851/http://dargahajmer.com/married-life/ This is also substantiated in A History Of Sufism in India, Sayyad Athar Abbas Rizvi, Vol 1, pg. 124. However, since the snippet in the video was not an explainer and merely a question, I realized it may be misinterpreted and therefore, the mention of the individual was removed. It bodes well, however, to repeat on record that I stand by the rest of my statement. Since the Islamists have been relentlessly demanding my arrest, I must place on record that if needed, I will be more than willing to defend my position in a court of law.It is said that the most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history. For what little my contribution is worth, I refuse to be a part of that obliteration – I will not be silenced. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In June 2021, the brand’s head women’s designer Vanessa Perilman in a private chat with a pro-Palestinian model lashed out at Hamas.Zara should not go this low! #BoycottZara pic.twitter.com/t54Jlaoot0The screenshot of her message, which was made viral by the pro-Palestine model Qaher Harhash, read, “Maybe if your people were educated then they wouldn’t blow up the hospitals and schools that Israel helped to pay for in Gaza.”Her message further read, “Israelis don’t teach children to hate or throw stones at soldiers as your people do.”In a stark reality check to the model, she wrote, “I think it’s funny that you are a model because, in reality, that is against what the Muslim faith believes in and if you were to come out of the closet in any Muslim country, you would be stoned to death.”The model continued to share more screenshots of Perilman’s messages even as she received death threats against her children. “I am sorry if this fight started something more than it should have but now it’s getting out of control,” her message read.“I am literally receiving death threats against by children,” she said to Harhash. She apologised to the pro-Palestinian model and deleted her social media accounts.Vanessa Perilman is a fashion industry veteran and obtained her current position at Zara in 2015. She works as “Head Designer for the Zara Women’s Collection” in Spain.Perilman, an Israeli, has worked with several brands including Forever 21, Club Monaco and The Donna Karan Company. She continues to stay off of social media.Perilman was brave enough to defend her country and did not shy away in the messages from calling out radicalism among Palestinians, many of whom have openly been supporting Hamas, as can be seen in the present day in the context of the 7th October terrorist attack.Moreover, the global fashion industry is known to experiment beyond the limits of comprehensible creativity. Tacky and weird creativity is what often draws attention to these brands and their presentation of their collection forms a key part of their selling point. It is very much likely that Islamists read into a fashion photo shoot only to bring back the Perilman controversy from the grave and attack her and the brand once again. After Israel launched an offensive strike in retaliation to the 7th October terrorist strikes by Hamas on Israel, pro-Palestinians and Islamists around the world have called for global boycott of Israeli brands.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
